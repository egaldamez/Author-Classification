 sister, Olive,
married George Stanhope, Dean of Canterbury, and left a daughter
Mary,--Swift's "Moll Stanhope,"--a beauty and a madcap, who married,
in 1712, William Burnet, son of Bishop Burnet, and died in 1714. Mary,
another sister of Lady Lucy's, married Augustine Armstrong, of Great
Ormond Street, and is the Mrs. Armstrong mentioned by Swift on Feb. 3,
1711, as a pretender to wit, without taste. Sir Berkeley Lucy's mother
was a daughter of the first Earl of Berkeley, and it was probably
through the Berkeleys that Swift came to know the Lucys.

18. Ann Long was sister to Sir James Long, and niece to Colonel
Strangeways. Once a beauty and toast of the Kit-Cat Club, she fell
into narrow circumstances through imprudence and the unkindness of her
friends, and retired under the name of Mrs. Smythe to Lynn, in Norfolk,
where she died in 1711 (see Journal, December 25, 1711). Swift said,
"She was the most beautiful person of the age she lived in; of great
honour and virtue, infinite sweetness and generosity of temper, and true
good sense" (Forster's Swift, 229). In a letter of December 1711, Swift
wrote that she "had every valuable quality of body and mind that could
make a lady loved and esteemed."

19. Said, I know not on what authority, to be Swift's friend, Mrs.
Barton. But Mrs. Barton is often mentioned by Swift as living in London
in 1710-11.

20. One of Swift's cousins, who was separated from her husband, a man of
bad character, living abroad. Her second husband, Lancelot, a servant of
Lord Sussex, lived in New Bond Street, and there Swift lodged in 1727.

21. 100,000 pounds.

22. Francis Stratford's name appears in the Dublin University Register
for 1686 immediately before Swift's. Budgell is believed to have
referred to the friendship of Swift and Stratford in the Spectator,
No. 353, where he describes two schoolfellows, and says that the man of
genius was buried in a country parsonage of 160 pounds a year, while
his friend, with the bare abilities of a common scrivener, had gained an
estate of above 100,000 pounds.

23. William Cowper, afterwards Lord Cowper.

24. Sir Simon Harcourt, afterwards Viscount Harcourt, had been counsel
for Sacheverell. On Sept. 19, 1710, he was appointed Attorney-General,
and on October 19 Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. In April 1713 he became
Lord Chancellor.

25. This may be some relative of Dr. John Freind (see Letter 9), or,
more probably, as Sir Henry Craik suggests, a misprint for Colonel
Frowde, Addison's friend (see Journal, Nov. 4, 1710). No officer named
Freind or Friend is mentioned in Dalton's English Army Lists.

26. See the Tatler, Nos. 124, 203. There are various allusions in the
"Wentworth Papers" to this, the first State Lottery of 1710; and two
bluecoat boys drawing out the tickets, and showing their hands to the
crowd, as Swift describes them, are shown in a reproduction of a picture
in a contemporary pamphlet given in Ashton's Social Life in the Reign of
Queen Anne, i. 115.

27. A few weeks later Swift wrote, "I took a fancy of resolving to grow
mad for it, but now it is off."

28. Sir John Holland, Bart., was a leading manager for the Commons in
the impeachment of Sacheverell. He succeeded Sir Thomas Felton in the
Comptrollership in March 1710.

29. Dryden Leach. (see Letter 7.)

30. William Pate, "bel esprit and woollen-draper," as Swift called him,
lived opposite the Royal Exchange. He was Sheriff of London in 1734,
and died in 1746. Arbuthnot, previous to matriculating at Oxford, lodged
with Pate, who gave him a letter of introduction to Dr. Charlett,
Master of University College; and Pate is supposed to have been the
woollen-draper, "remarkable for his learning and good-nature," who is
mentioned by Steele in the Guardian, No. 141.

31. James Brydges, son of Lord Chandos of Sudeley, was appointed
Paymaster-General of Forces Abroad in 1707. He succeeded his father
as Baron Chandos in 1714, and was created Duke of Chandos in 1729. The
"princely Chandos" and his house at Canons suggested to Pope the Timon's
villa of the "Epistle to Lord Burlington." The Duke died in 1744.

32. Charles Talbot, created Duke of Shrewsbury in 1694, was held in
great esteem by William III., and was Lord Chamberlain under Anne. In
1713 he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and held various offices
under George I., until his death in 1718. "Before he was o. age," says
Macaulay, "he was allowed to be one of the finest gentlemen and finest
scholars of his time."

33. See No. 230.

34. William Cavendish, second Duke of Devonshire (1673-1729), who was
Lord Steward from 1707 to 1710 and from 1714 to 1716. Afterwards he was
Lord President of the Council. Swift's comment on Macky's character of
this Whig nobleman was, "A very poor understanding."

35. John Annesley, fourth Earl of Anglesea, a young nobleman of
great promise, had only recently been appointed joint Vice-Treasurer,
Receiver-General, and Paymaster of the Forces in Ireland, and sworn of
the Privy Council.

36. Nichols, followed by subsequent editors, suggested that "Durham"
was a mistake for "St. David's," because Dr. George Bull, Bishop
