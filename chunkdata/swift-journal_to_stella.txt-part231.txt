1 he was appointed Governor of Hull, and he died, a
Lieutenant-General, in 1737 (Dalton's Army Lists, iii. 153)

8 Charles Seymour, sixth Duke of Somerset (1662-1748), known as
"the proud Duke of Somerset." Through the influence which his
wife--afterwards Mistress of the Robes (see Letter 17, note 10)--had
obtained over the Queen, he bore no small part in bringing about the
changes of 1710. His intrigues during this period were, however, mainly
actuated by jealousy of Marlborough, and he had really no sympathies
with the Tories. His intrigues with the Whigs caused the utmost alarm to
St. John and to Swift.

9 The third and last reference to Vanessa in the Journal.

10 "Pray God preserve her life, which is of great importance" (Swift
to Archbishop King, Aug. 15, 1711). St. John was at this moment very
anxious to conciliate Mrs. Masham, as he felt that she was the only
person capable of counteracting the intrigues of the Duchess of Somerset
with the Queen.

11 Pontack, of Abchurch Lane, son of Arnaud de Pontac, President of
the Parliament of Bordeaux, was proprietor of the most fashionable
eating-house in London. There the Royal Society met annually at dinner
until 1746. Several writers speak of the dinners at a guinea a head
and upwards served at Pontack's, and Swift comments on the price of the
wine.

12 "His name was Read" (Scott).

13 Up to the end of 1709 the warrants for the payment of the works
at Blenheim had been regularly issued by Godolphin and paid at the
Treasury; over 200,000 pounds was expended in this manner. But after
the dismissal of the Whigs the Queen drew tight the purse-strings. The
20,000 pounds mentioned by Swift was paid in 1711, but on June 1, 1712,
Anne gave positive orders that nothing further should be allowed for
Blenheim, though 12,000 pounds remained due to the contractors.

14 The piercing of the lines before Bouchain, which Villars had declared
to be the non plus ultra of the Allies, one of the most striking proofs
of Marlborough's military genius.

16 A fashionable gaming-house in St. James's Street.

17 See Letter 6, note 15. The Grange, near Alresford, Hampshire, was
Henley's seat. His wife (see Letter 12, note 24) was the daughter of
Peregrine Bertie, son of Montagu Bertie, second Earl of Lindsey; and
Earl Poulett (see Letter 20, note 7) married Bridget, an elder daughter
of Bertie's.

18 William Henry Hyde, Earl of Danby, grandson of the first Duke of
Leeds (see Letter 8, note 22), and eldest son of Peregrine Osborne,
Baron Osborne and Viscount Dunblane, who succeeded to the dukedom in
1712. Owing to this young man's death (at the age of twenty-one), his
brother, Peregrine Hyde, Marquis of Caermarthen, who married Harley's
daughter Elizabeth, afterwards became third Duke of Leeds.

21 William Gregg was a clerk in Harley's office when the latter was
Secretary of State under the Whig Administration. In 1707-8 he was in
treasonable correspondence with M. de Chamillart, the French Secretary
of State. When he was detected he was tried for high treason, and hanged
on April 28. The Lords who examined Gregg did their utmost to establish
Harley's complicity, which Gregg, however, with his dying breath
solemnly denied.

entitled, A Letter to the Seven Lords of the Committee appointed to
examine Gregg.

23 See Letter 13, note 10. There is no copy in the British Museum.

24 Thomas Parnell, the poet, married, in 1706, Anne, daughter of Thomas
Minchin, of Tipperary. In 1711 Parnell was thirty-two years of age,
and was Archdeacon of Clogher and Vicar of Clontibret. Swift took much
trouble to obtain for Parnell the friendship of Bolingbroke and other
persons of note, and Parnell became a member of the Scriblerus Club.
In 1716 he was made Vicar of Finglas, and after his death in 1718
Pope prepared an edition of his poems. The fits of depression to which
Parnell was liable became more marked after his wife's death, and he
seems to have to some extent given way to drink. His sincerity and charm
of manner made him welcome with men of both parties.

25 Dr. Henry Compton had been Bishop of London since 1675. He was
dangerously ill early in 1711, but he lived until 1713, when he was
eighty-one.

28 L'Estrange speaks of "a whiffling fop" and Swift says, "Every
whiffler in a laced coat, who frequents the chocolate-house, shall talk
of the Constitution."

29 Prior's first visit to France with a view to the secret negotiations
with that country which the Ministers were now bent on carrying
through, had been made in July, when he and Gaultier reached Calais in
a fishing-boat and proceeded to Fontainbleau under assumed names. He
returned to England in August, but was recognised at Dover, whence the
news spread all over London, to the great annoyance of the Ministers.
The officer who recognised Prior was John Macky, reputed author of those
Characters upon which Swift wrote comments. Formerly a secret service
agent under W
