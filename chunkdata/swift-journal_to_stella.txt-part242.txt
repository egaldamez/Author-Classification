of
more than half but not exceeding a whole sheet. Swift opposed the idea
in January 1711 (see Letter 15, note 1), and Defoe argued against the
Bill in the Review for April 26, 1712, and following numbers. Addison,
in the Spectator, No. 445, spoke of the mortality among authors
resulting from the Stamp Act as "the fall of the leaf."

4 The title is, "Lewis Baboon turned honest, and John Bull politician.
Being the Fourth Part of Law is a Bottomless Pit." This pamphlet--really
the fifth of the series--appeared on July 31, 1712.

5 Elizabeth Villiers, eldest daughter of Sir Edward Villiers, Knight
Marischal of England, and sister of the first Earl of Jersey. In
1695 she married Lord George Hamilton (son of Lord William Douglas,
afterwards Duke of Hamilton), who was raised to the peerage of Scotland
in 1696 as Earl of Orkney. William III. gave her an Irish estate worth
26,000 pounds a year. Swift's opinion of her wisdom is confirmed by Lord
Lansdowne, who speaks, in his Progress of Poetry, of

     "Villiers, for wisdom and deep judgment famed,
      Of a high race, victorious beauty brings
      To grace our Courts, and captivate our Kings."

The "beauty" seems a poetic licence; Swift says the lady squinted "like
a dragon."

2 "Sometimes, when better company was not to be had, he (Swift) was
honoured by being invited to play at cards with his patron; and on such
occasions Sir William was so generous as to give his antagonist a little
silver to begin with" (Macaulay, History of England, chap. xix.).

published from 1699 to 1711.

6 Lady Elizabeth Savage, daughter of Richard, fourth Earl Rivers (see
Letter 11, note 9), was the second wife of James Barry, fourth Earl of
Barrymore. Of Earl Rivers' illegitimate children, one, Bessy, married
(1) Frederick Nassau, third Earl of Rochford, and (2) a clergyman
named Carter; while another, Richard Savage, was the poet. Earl Rivers'
successor, John Savage, the fifth Earl, was a Roman Catholic priest,
the grandson of John, first Earl Rivers. On his death in 1728 the title
became extinct.

Molyneux (1656-1698), M.P. for Dublin University, a writer on
philosophical and scientific subjects, and the friend of Locke. Samuel
Molyneux took his M.A. degree in Dublin in 1710, and in 1712 visited
England. He was befriended by the Duke of Marlborough at Antwerp, and in
1714 was sent by the Duke on a mission to the Court of Hanover. He
held office under George I., but devoted most of his attention to
astronomical research, until his death in 1728.

9 George Ridpath (died 1726), a Whig journalist, of whom Pope (Dunciad,
i. 208) wrote-- "To Dulness Ridpath is as dear as Mist." He edited the
Flying Post for some years, and also wrote for the Medley in 1712.
In September William Hurt and Ridpath were arrested for libellous
and seditious articles, but were released on bail. On October 23 they
appeared before the Court of Queen's Bench, and were continued on their
recognizances. In February 1713 Ridpath was tried and, in spite of
an able defence by leading Whig lawyers, was convicted. Sentence was
postponed, and when Ridpath failed to appear, as ordered, in April, his
recognizances were escheated, and
