of King's Bench in Ireland in 1682, and died in 1699.

2 "Marmaduke Coghill, LL.D., was judge of the Prerogative Court in
Ireland. About this time he courted a lady, and was soon to have been
married to her; but unfortunately a cause was brought to trial before
him, wherein a man was sued for beating his wife. When the matter was
agitated, the Doctor gave his opinion, 'That although a man had no right
to beat his wife unmercifully, yet that, with such a little cane or
switch as he then held in his hand, a husband was at liberty, and was
invested with a power, to give his wife moderate correction'; which
opinion determined the lady against having the Doctor. He died an old
man and a bachelor" (Deane Swift). See also Lascelles, Liber Muner.
Hibern., part ii. p. 80.

3 This was a common exclamation of the time, but the spelling varies in
different writers. It seems to be a corruption of "God so," or "God
ho," but there may have been a confusion with "cat-so," derived from the
Italian "cazzo."

4 See Letter 9, note 28. Mrs. Manley was now editing the Examiner.

5 Sir Henry Belasyse was sent to Spain as Commissioner to inquire into
the state of the English forces in that country. The son of Sir Richard
Belasyse, Knight of Ludworth, Durham, Sir Henry finished a chequered
career in 1717, when he was buried in Westminster Abbey (Dalton's
Army Lists, ii. 228). In his earlier years he served under the
United Provinces, and after the accession of William was made a
Brigadier-General in the English army, and in 1694, Lieutenant-General.
In 1702 he was second in command of the expedition to Cadiz, but he was
dismissed the service in consequence of the looting of Port St. Mary.
Subsequently he was elected M.P. for Durham, and in 1713 was appointed
Governor of Berwick.

probability he was Richard Tisdall, Registrar of the Irish Court of
Chancery, and M.P. for Dundalk (1707-1713) and County Louth (1713-1727).
He married Marian, daughter of Richard Boyle, M.P., and died in 1742.
Richard Tisdall was a relative of Stella's suitor, the Rev. William
Tisdall, and years afterwards Swift took an interest in his son Philip,
who became a Secretary of State and Leader of the Irish House of
Commons.

(see Letter 5, note 11), married William Capel, third Earl of Essex. Her
daughter Charlotte's husband, the son of the Earl of Jersey, was created
Earl of Clarendon in 1776. Lady Jane's younger sister, Catherine,

event of their negotiations for a peace being successful. He married
Lady Margaret Cavendish, daughter and co-heiress of Henry Cavendish,
second Duke of Newcastle, and was one of the richest nobles in
England. His death, on July 15, 1711, was the result of a fall while
