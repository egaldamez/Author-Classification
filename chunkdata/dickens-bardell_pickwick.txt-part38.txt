fellows saw what pressure could be
put on the benevolent nature of Mr. Pickwick, who could not endure that a
respectable woman should be exposed to the contamination of a debtor's
prison.  And their sagacity was to be justified, and on the very next
day, too.

It is curious, however, that no mention is made of Mrs. Bardell's
release.  It, of course, took place before Mr. Pickwick's.  Here again
Dodson and Fogg behaved very fairly, for they allowed both her and Mr.
Pickwick to be released, without receiving payment, but simply on "an
understanding" by Perker.  As it turned out, indeed, they were not paid
for some weeks.

The processes by which Mr. Pickwick was got into the Fleet were
complicated enough, _Habeas Corpus_, appearing before functionaries, etc.
But it is odd that in cases of persons of lower degree these seemed not
to be necessary.  We do not hear of them in Sam's instance.  While Mrs.
Bardell, was taken straight from "the Spaniards," to the prison door, she
was not even formally arrested by the Bailiff, though he was in
attendance.  He sat afar off at Hampstead, taking his drink--and on the
box during the drive.  She might be said to have been arbitrarily taken
to the prison by Jackson--without a legal warrant.  Had not the business
been compromised, some other astute firm of attorneys might have found
subject for an action against Dodson and Fogg.

Another of the humorous incidents connected with the case is old Weller's
firm persuasion that Mr. Pickwick was to "stand his trial," as though he
were indicted for some criminal offence.  We find him always astray as to
when he was to be "tried," etc.  This is a most natural impression among
the lower classes, who are not very clear as to the distinction between
civil and criminal process, being most familiar with the latter.  In the
same spirit is his humorous suggestion of securing an _alibi_, as the
best method of getting Mr. Pickwick off.  "O Sammy, Sammy, vy worn't
there a alleybi!"

                                * * * * *

Such is "The Trial in Pickwick."

Is there any writer, now living, I may be asked, who could furnish such a
picture as this, one so full of reality and true humour, of one of our
modern Courts of Justice?  The answer must be that it would be idle to
look for such a person.  There are thousands who could supply minute
drawings in which not a single detail would be omitted.  But the piercing
to the essence, the happy generalization, the knowledge of the true
points of character, these would be sought in vain.




Footnotes:


{26}  So confused is the chronology of _Pickwick_, that it is difficult
to fix the exact date of the Trial.  Boz, writing some ten years after
the event, seems to have got a little confused and uncertain as to the
exact year of the Trial.  He first fixed the opening of the story in
1817: but on coming to the compromising incident in Goswell Street, which
occurred only a few weeks later, he changed the year to 1827.  Then
Jingle's anachronism of the French Revolution of July suggested that the
new date would not do.  So 1830 was next adopted.  But this did not end
the matter, for in the "errata" we are directed to change this date back
again to 1827.  And so it now stands.  The Trial therefore really took
place on April 1, 1828.

{84}  Seven years after the Trial this monopoly was taken away from the
Serjeants--namely in 1834: then capriciously given back to them, and
finally abolished in 1840.

{85}  I have heard from the daughter of Mr. Chapman, the original
publisher of _Pickwick_, that Talfourd revised and directed the "Trial."
On one occasion Boz was dining with him when the proof was brought in,
with some legal mistakes noted by Talfourd.  Boz left the table and put
it right.
