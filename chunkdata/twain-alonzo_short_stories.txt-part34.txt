"B' George, the Countess was there!"

"Well, what of that?--don't she know you?"

"Know me? Absolutely worships me. I just did happen to catch a glimpse
of her before she saw me--and out I shot. Haven't seen her for two
months--to rush in on her without any warning might have been fatal. She
could not have stood it. I didn't know she was in town--thought she
was at the castle. Let me lean on you--just a moment--there; now I
am better--thank you; thank you ever so much. Lord bless me, what an
escape!"

In most things Rogers was by no means a fool. In some things it was

was in the "deadest" earnest in these matters. He died at sea, last
summer, as the "Earl of Ramsgate."
