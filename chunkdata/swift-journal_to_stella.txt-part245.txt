d her
Allies. She has now prorogued the best Parliament that ever assembled in
her reign and respited her own glory, and the wishes, prayers, and wants
of her people, only to give some of her Allies an opportunity to
think of the returns they owe her, and try if there be such a thing as
gratitude, justice, or humanity in Europe. The conduct of Her Majesty
is without parallel. Never was so great a condescension made to the
unreasonable clamours of an insolent faction now dwindled to the most
contemptible circumstances."--Examiner, Jan. 12-16, 1712(-13).

21 Mr. Collins's "Discourse of Freethinking, put into plain English
by way of Abstract, for the use of the Poor," an ironical pamphlet on
Arthur Collins's Discourse of Freethinking, 1713.

23 A line here has been erased. Forster imagined that he read, "Nite
dear MD, drowsy drowsy dear."

25 Writing in October 1713, Lord Berkeley of Stratton told Lord
Strafford of "a fine prank of the widow Lady Jersey" (see Letter 29,
note 3). "It is well known her lord died much in debt, and she, after
taking upon her the administration, sold everything and made what money
she could, and is run away into France without paying a farthing of the
debts, with only one servant and unknown to all her friends, and hath
taken her youngest son, as 'tis supposed to make herself a merit in
breeding him a papist. My Lord Bolingbroke sent after her, but too late,
and they say the Queen hath writ a letter with her own hand to the King
of France to send back the boy" (Wentworth Papers, p. 357). See also
Letter 63, note 8. I am not sure whether in the present passage Swift is
referring to the widow or the younger Lady Jersey (see Letter 33, note
10).

26 Sir Thomas Clarges, Bart. (died 1759), M.P. for Lostwithiel,
married Barbara, youngest daughter of John Berkeley, fourth Viscount
Fitz-Hardinge, and of Barbara Villiers (see Letter 54, note 11),
daughter of Sir Edward Villiers.

27 See Letter 43, Mar. 21, 1711-12 and Letter 49, Jul. 1, 1712.

28 Altered from "11" in the MS. It is not certain where the error in the
dates began; but the entry of the 6th must be correctly dated, because
the Feb. 6 was the Queen's Birthday.

29 See Letter 43, note 11 and Letter 57, note 12.


Letter 60.

1 Addressed to "Mrs. Dingley," etc. Endorsed "Mar. 7."

3 Sedan chairs were then comparatively novel (see Gay's Trivia).

4 Some words obliterated. Forster reads, "Nite MD, My own deelest MD."

5 Peter Wentworth wrote to Lord Strafford, on Feb. 17, 1713, "Poor Mr.
Harrison is very much lamented; he died last Saturday. Dr. Swift told me
that he had told him... he owed about 300 pounds, and the Queen owed him
500 pounds, and that if you or some of your people could send an account
of his debts, that I might give it to him, he would undertake to solicit
Lord Treasurer and get this 500 pounds, and give the remainder to his
mother and sister" (Wentworth Papers, 320).

6 George St. John (eldest son of Sir Harry St. John by his second
marriage) was Secretary to the English Plenipotentiaries at Utrecht. He
died at Venice in 1716 (Lady Cowper's Diary, 65).

7 Forster wrongly reads, "poor."

8 "Putt" (MS.).

9 See Letter 59, note 26.

10 Montagu Bertie, second Earl of Abingdon (died 1743), was a strong
Tory.

11 See Letter 11, note 61. These friends were together again on an
expedition to Bath in 1715, when Jervas wrote to Pope (Aug. 12, 1715)
that Arbuthnot, Disney, and he were to meet at Hyde Park Corner,
proceed to Mr. Hill's at Egham, meet Pope next day, and then go to Lord
Stawell's to lodge the night. Lord Stawell's seat, Aldermaston, was
seventeen miles from Binfield.
