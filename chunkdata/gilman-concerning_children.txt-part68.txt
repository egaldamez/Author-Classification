    THE THINGS THAT COUNT

    By ELIZABETH KNIGHT TOMPKINS

    AUTHOR OF "HER MAJESTY," "THE BROKEN RING," ETC.

    _12mo, cloth, 3s. 6d._


In her well-known graphic style, Miss Tompkins has made a strong and
vivid study of a character hitherto not delineated in American
fiction. Her heroine is an indolent young woman of small means, who
lives by visiting the houses of wealthy friends. The story of her
regeneration, through her affection for a man of strong character, is
cleverly told.
