 eldest son of the sixth Earl of
Kinnoull, was made a Teller of the Exchequer in August, and a peer of
Great Britain in December 1711, with the title of Baron Hay. He married,
in 1709, Abigail, Harley's younger daughter, and he succeeded his father
in the earldom of Kinnoull in 1719.

35 Edward Harley, afterwards Lord Harley, who succeeded his father as
Earl of Oxford in 1724. He married Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles,
daughter of the Duke of Newcastle, but died without male issue in 1741.
His interest in literature caused him to form the collection known as
the Harleian Miscellany.

36 William Penn (1644-1718), the celebrated founder of Pennsylvania.
Swift says that he "spoke very agreeably, and with much spirit."

37 This "Memorial to Mr. Harley about the First-Fruits" is dated Oct. 7,
1710.

38 Henry St. John, created Viscount Bolingbroke in July 1712. In the
quarrel between Oxford and Bolingbroke in 1714, Swift's sympathies were
with Oxford.

39 I.e., it is decreed by fate. So Tillotson says, "These things are
fatal and necessary."

46 L'Estrange speaks of "trencher-flies and spungers."

47 See Letter 1, note 10.

48 Samuel Garth, physician and member of the Kit-Cat Club, was knighted
in 1714. He is best known by his satirical poem, The Dispensary, 1699.

49 Gay speaks of "Wondering Main, so fat, with laughing eyes" (Mr.
Pope's Welcome from Greece, st. xvii.).

He died unmarried in 1715.

1715, but died unmarried in 1720.

6 The Devil Tavern was the meeting-place of Ben Jonson's Apollo Club.
The house was pulled down in 1787.

that seat until his death in 1719.

8 Captain Charles Lavallee, who served in the Cadiz Expedition of 1702,
and was appointed a captain in Colonel Hans Hamilton's Regiment of Foot
in 1706 (Luttrell, v. 175, vi. 640; Dalton's English Army Lists, iv.
126).

10 The Tatler, No. 230, Sid Hamet's Rod, and the ballad (now lost) on
the Westminster Election.

11 The Earl of Galway (1648-1720), who lost the battle of Almanza to
the Duke of Berwick in 1707. Originally the Marquis de Ruvigny, a
French refugee, he had been made Viscount Galway and Earl of Galway
successively by William III.

12 William Harrison, the son of a doctor at St. Cross, Winchester, had
been recommended to Swift by Addison, who obtained for him the post of
governor to the Duke of Queensberry's son. In Jan. 1711 Harrison began
the issue of a continuation of Steele's Tatler with Swift's assistance,
but without success. In May 1711, St. John gave Harrison the appointment
of secretary to Lord Raby, Ambassador Extraordinary at the Hague, and in
Jan. 1713 Harrison brought the Barrier Treaty to England. He died in
the following month, at the age of twenty-seven, and Lady Strafford says
that "his brother poets buried him, as Mr. Addison, Mr. Philips, and Dr.
Swift." Tickell calls him "that much loved youth," and Swift felt his
death keenly. Harrison's best poem is Woodstock Park, 1706.

14 James Douglas, second Duke of Queensberry and Duke of Dover
(1662-1711), was appointed joint Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1708, and
third Secretary of State in 1709. Harrison must have been "governor"
either to the third son, Charles, Marquis of Beverley (born 1698), who
succeeded to the dukedom in 1711, or to the fourth son, George, born in
1701.

15 Anthony Henley, son of Sir Robert Henley, M.P. for Andover, was
a favourite with the wits in London. He was a strong Whig, and
occasionally contributed to the Tatler and Maynwaring's Medley. Garth
dedicated The Dispensary to him. Swift records Henley's death from
apoplexy in August 1711.

16 Sir William Ashurst, Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and Mr. John Ward were
replaced by Sir Richard Hoare, Sir George Newland, and Mr. John Cass at
the election for the City in 1710. Scott was wrong in saying that the
Whigs lost also the fourth seat, for Sir William Withers had been member
for the City since 1707.

17 Sir Richard Onslow, Bart., was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons
in 1708. Under George I. he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
was elevated to the peerage as Baron Onslow in 1716. He died in the
following year.

18 "The upper part of the letter was a little besmeared with some such
stuff; the mark is still on it" (Deane Swift).

became Dean of Derry in 1699. He died in 17
