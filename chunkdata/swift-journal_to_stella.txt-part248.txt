rs (1899), v. 276.

10 Scoffed, jeered.

11 Dr. Gastrell (see Letter 25, note 8).

12 George Berkeley, afterwards Bishop of Cloyne, but then a young man
of twenty-eight, came to London in January 1713. He was already known
by his "New Theory of Vision" and "Treatise on the Principles of Human
Knowledge", and he brought with him his "Three Dialogues between Hylas
and Philonous". Steele was among the first to welcome him, and he soon
made the acquaintance of Addison, Pope, and Swift. On March 27, Berkeley
wrote to Sir John Perceval of the breach between Swift and the Whigs:
"Dr. Swift's wit is admired by both of them (Addison and Steele),
and indeed by his greatest enemies, and... I think him one of the
best-matured and agreeable men in the world." In November 1713
Swift procured for Berkeley the chaplaincy and secretaryship to Lord
Peterborough, the new Envoy to Sicily.

13 Forster reads, "all oo sawcy Ppt can say oo may see me"; but the
words are illegible.

14 Possibly "see," written in mistake for "say."

15 "J" (MS.).

16 Obliterated. Forster imagined that he read, "Nite dee logues. Poo
Mr."

17 There were two General Hamiltons at this time; probably Swift's
acquaintance was Gustavus Hamilton (1639-1723), who was created Viscount
Boyne in 1717. Hamilton distinguished himself at the battle of the Boyne
and the capture of Athlone, and was made Brigadier-General in 1696, and
Major General in 1703. He took part in the siege of Vigo, and was made a
member of the Privy Council in 1710.

18 See Letter 43, note 38.

19 The History of the Peace of Utrecht.

20 This is Forster's reading, and appears to be correct. The last word,
which he gives as "iss truly," is illegible.

21 Belonging to Ireland.

22 See Letter 40, note 1.

23 Another excellent reading of Forster's. I cannot decipher the last
word, which he gives as "dee rogues."

24 Sentence obliterated.

25 The number at the beginning of each entry in the Journal.

26 Mr. Ryland's reading. Forster has "morning, dee."

27 Dr. Thomas Lindsay (see Letter 6, note 45).

28 I think the "MD" is right, though Forster gives "M." The "Pr" is
probably an abbreviation of "Pdfr."

29 The last three lines have been obliterated.


Letter 64.

1 Addressed to "Mrs. Dingley," etc. Endorsed "May 22."

2 Illegible. Forster reads, "and dee deelest Ppt."

3 The last few words have been partially obliterated.

4 Am very angry. The last word is scribbled over.

5 The History of the Peace of Utrecht.

6 The signature has been cut off.


Letter 65.

1 Addressed to "Mrs. Dingley," etc. Endorsed "Chester Letter."

2 "Others" (MS.).

3 See Letter 10, note 31 and Letter 31, note 1.
