 take care of her husband. She "said she had none to trust
but me, and the poor creature's tears came fresh in her eyes." Though
the marriage was, naturally enough, unhappy, she did not leave St.
John's house until 1713, and she returned to him when he fell from
power. There are letters from her to Swift as late as 1716, not
only doing her best to defend his honour, but speaking of him with
tenderness.

16 "Battoon" means (1) a truncheon; (2) a staff of office. Luttrell, in
1704, speaks of "a battoon set with diamonds sent him from the French
king."

17 Edward Harley, second son of Sir Edward Harley, was M.P. for
Leominster and Recorder of the same town. In 1702 he was appointed
Auditor of the Imposts, a post which he held until his death in 1735.
His wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Foley, was a sister of Robert
Harley's wife, and his eldest son eventually became third Earl of
Oxford. Harley published several books on biblical subjects.

18 See Letter 6, note 12. The last number of Steele's Tatler appeared on
Jan. 2, 1711; Harrison's paper reached to fifty-two numbers.

21 Published by John Baker and John Morphew. See Aitken's Life of
Steele, i. 299-301.

22 In No. 224 of the Tatler, Addison, speaking of polemical
advertisements, says: "The inventors of Strops for Razors have written
against one another this way for several years, and that with great
bitterness." See also Spectator, Nos. 428, 509, and the Postman for
March 23, 1703: "The so much famed strops for setting razors, etc., are
only to be had at Jacob's Coffee-house.... Beware of counterfeits, for
such are abroad."

23 Sir John Holland (see Letter 3, note 28).

24 Addison speaks of a fine flaxen long wig costing thirty guineas
(Guardian, No. 97), and Duumvir's fair wig, which Phillis threw into the
fire, cost forty guineas (Tatler, No. 54)

25 Swift's mother, Abigail Erick, was of a Leicestershire family, and
after her husband's death she spent much of her time with her friends
near her old home. Mr. Worrall, vicar of St. Patrick's, with whom Swift
was on terms of intimacy in 1728-29, was evidently a relative of the
Worralls where Mrs. Swift had lodged, and we may reasonably suppose that
he owed the living to Swift's interest in the family.

26 The title of a humorous poem by Lydgate. A "lickpenny" is a greedy or
grasping person.

27 Small wooden blocks used for lighting fires. See Swift ("Description
of the Morning"),     "The small-coal man was heard with cadence deep,
      Till drowned in shriller notes of chimney-sweep;" and Gay (Trivia, ii.
35),     "When small-coal murmurs in the hoarser throat,
      From smutty dangers guard thy threatened coat."

28 The Tory Ministers.

2 Thomas Southerne's play of Oroonoko, based on Mrs. Aphra Behn's novel
of the same name, was first acted in 1696.

3 "Mrs." Cross created the part of Mrs. Clerimont in Steele's Tender
Husband in 1705.

5 George Granville, afterwards Lord Lansdowne, was M.P. for Cornwall,
and Secretary at War. In December 1711 he was raised to the peerage,
and in 1712 was appointed Comptroller of the Household. He died in 1735,
when the title became extinct. Granville wrote plays and poems, and
was a patron of both Dryden and Pope. Pope called him "Granville the
polite." His Works in Verse and Prose appeared in 1732.

6 Samuel Masham, son of Sir Francis Masham, Bart., had been a page to
the Queen while Princess of Denmark, and an equerry and gentleman of the
bed-chamber to Prince George. He married Abigail Hill (see Letter 16,
note 7), daughter of Francis Hill, a Turkey merchant, and sister of
General John Hill, and through that lady's influence with the Queen he
was raised to the peerage as Baron Masham, in January 1712. Under George
I. he was Remembrancer of the Exchequer. He died in 1758.

7 A roughly printed pamphlet, The Honourable Descent, Life, and True
Character of the... Earl of Wharton, appeared early in 1711, in reply to
Swift's Short Character; but that can hardly be the pamphlet referred
to here, because it is directed against libellers and backbiters, and
cannot be described as "pretty civil."

8 "In that word (the seven last words of the sentence huddled into one)
there were some puzzling characters" (Deane Swift).

9 Sir Robert Worsley, Bart., married, in 1690, Frances, only daughter
of the first Viscount Weymouth. Their daughter Frances married Lord
Carteret (see Letter 12, note 22) in 1710. In a letter to Colonel Hunter
in March 1709 Swift spoke of Lady (then Mrs.) Worsley as one of the
principal beauties in town. See, too, Swift's letter to her of April 19,
1730: "My Lady Carteret has been the best queen we have known in Ireland
these many years; yet is she mortally hated by all the young girls,
because (and it is your fault) she is handsomer than all of them
together."
