The second son, Robert, was made Archbishop of York in 1761.

15 Writing of Peperharrow, Manning and Bray state (Surrey, ii. 32, 47)
that Oxenford Grange was conveyed to Philip Froud (died 1736) in 1700,
and was sold by him in 1713 to Alan Broderick, afterwards Viscount
Midleton. This Froud (Swift's "old Frowde") had been Deputy
Postmaster-General; he was son of Sir Philip Frowde, who was knighted in
1665 (Le Neve's Knights, Harleian Society, p. 190), and his son Philip
was Addison's friend (see Letter 8, note 13).

16 Probably the Charles Child, Esq., of Farnham, whose death is recorded
in the Gentleman's Magazine for 1754.

17 Grace Spencer was probably Mrs. Proby's sister (see Letter 19, note
3).

18 Cf. Shakespeare, As You Like It, v. 3: "Shall we clap into 't
roundly, without hawking or spitting, which are the only prologues to a
bad voice?"

19 In the "Verses on his own Death," 1731, Swift says

     "When daily howd'y's come of course,
      And servants answer, 'Worse and worse!'"

Cf. Steele (Tatler, No. 109),

"After so many howdies, you proceed to visit or not, as you like the run
of each other's reputation or fortune,"

and (Spectator, No. 143),

     "the howd'ye servants of our women."

3 The Tories alleged that the Duke of Marlborough, the Duke of Montagu,
Steele, etc., were to take part in the procession (cf. Spectator,
No. 269). Swift admits that the images seized were worth less than 40
pounds, and not 1000 pounds, as he had said, and that the Devil was not
like Harley; yet he employed someone to write a lying pamphlet, A True
Relation of the Several Facts and Circumstances of the Intended Riot and
Tumult, etc.

18 It is not known whether or no this was Dr. William Savage, Master
of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. No copy of the sermon--if it was
printed--has been found. See Courtenay's Memoirs of Sir William Temple.

circulation. See a paper by Edward Solly in the Antiquarian Magazine,

20 Allen Bathurst, M.P. (1684-1775), created Baron Bathurst in December
1711, and Earl Bathurst in 1772. His second and eldest surviving son
was appointed Lord Chancellor in the year preceding the father's
death. Writing to her son in January 1711 (Wentworth Papers, 173), Lady
Wentworth said of Bathurst, "He is, next to you, the finest gentleman
and the best young man I know; I love him dearly."

21 See Letter 9, note 17.

22 See Letter 16, note 20.

23 Swift is alluding to the quarrel between Lord Santry (see Letter
23, note 2) and Francis Higgins (see Letter 34, note 10), which led
to Higgins's prosecution. The matter is described at length in Boyer s
Political State, 1711, pp. 617 seq.

6 The Percevals were among Swift's principal friends in the
neighbourhood of Laracor. In a letter to John Temple in 1706 (Forster's
Life of Swift, 182) Swift alludes to Perceval; in spite of different
views in politics, "I always loved him," says Swift, "very well as a man
of very good understanding and humour." Perceval was related to Sir John
Perceval, afterwards Earl of Egmont (see Letter 18, note 15).
