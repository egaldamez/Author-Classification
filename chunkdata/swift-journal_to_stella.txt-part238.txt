1691, and died in 1719.

6 Lady Catherine Hyde was an unmarried daughter of Laurence Hyde, first
Earl of Rochester (see Letter 8, note 22). Notwithstanding Swift's
express statement that the lady to whom he here refers was the late
Earl's daughter, and the allusion to her sister, Lady Dalkeith, in
Letter 60, note 26, she has been confused by previous editors with her
niece, Lady Catherine Hyde (see Letter 26, note 24), daughter of the
second Earl, and afterwards Duchess of Queensberry. That lady, not long
afterwards to be celebrated by Prior, was a child under twelve when
Swift wrote.

LETTER 41.

1 This letter, the first of the series published by Hawkesworth, of
which we have the originals (see Preface), was addressed "To Mrs.
Johnson at her Lodgings over against St. Mary's Church, near Capell
Street, Dublin, Ireland"; and was endorsed by her "Recd. Mar. 1st."

5 Charles Ross, son of the eleventh Baron Ross, was Colonel of the Royal
Irish Dragoons from 1695 to 1705. He was a Lieutenant-General under the
Duke of Ormond in Flanders, and died in 1732 (Dalton, ii. 212, iii. 34).

6 Charles Paulet, Marquis of Winchester, succeeded his father (see
Letter 31, note 2) as third Duke of Bolton in 1722. He married, as his
second wife, Lavinia Fenton, the actress who took the part of Polly
Peacham in Gay's Beggars Opera in 1728, and he died in 1754.

7 John Blith, or Bligh, son of the Right Hon. Thomas Bligh, M.P. of
Rathmore, Co. Meath (see Letter 4, note 22). In August 1713 he married
Lady Theodosia Hyde, daughter of Edward, third Earl of Clarendon. Lord
Berkeley of Stratton wrote, "Lady Theodosia Hyde... is married to an
Irish Mr. Blythe, of a good estate, who will soon have enough of her,
if I can give any guess" (Wentworth Papers, 353). In 1715 Bligh was
made Baron Clifton, of Rathmore, and Earl of Darnley in 1725. He died in
1728.
