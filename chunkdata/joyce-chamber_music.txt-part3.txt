men
     Prefer a lying clamour before you:
     Sweetheart, be at peace again--
     Can they dishonour you?

     They are sadder than all tears;
     Their lives ascend as a continual sigh.
     Proudly answer to their tears:
     As they deny, deny.

     In the dark pine-wood
     I would we lay,
     In deep cool shadow
     At noon of day.

     How sweet to lie there,
     Sweet to kiss,
     Where the great pine-forest
     Enaisled is!

     Thy kiss descending
     Sweeter were
     With a soft tumult
     Of thy hair.

     O unto the pine-wood
     At noon of day
     Come with me now,
     Sweet love, away.




XXI

     He who hath glory lost, nor hath
     Found any soul to fellow his,
     Among his foes in scorn and wrath
     Holding to ancient nobleness,
     That high unconsortable one--
     His love is his companion.




XXII

     Of that so sweet imprisonment
     My soul, dearest, is fain--
     Soft arms that woo me to relent
     And woo me to detain.
     Ah, could they ever hold me there
     Gladly were I a prisoner!

     Dearest, through interwoven arms
     By love made tremulous,
     That night allures me where alarms
     Nowise may trouble us;
     But sleep to dreamier sleep be wed
     Where soul with soul lies prisoned.




XXIII

     This heart that flutters near my heart
     My hope and all my riches is,
     Unhappy when we draw apart
     And happy between kiss and kiss:
     My hope and all my riches--yes!--
     And all my happiness.

     For there, as in some mossy nest
     The wrens will divers treasures keep,
     I laid those treasures I possessed
     Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.
     Shall we not be as wise as they
     Though love live but a day?




XXIV

     Silently she's combing,
     Combing her long hair
     Silently and graciously,
     With many a pretty air.

     The sun is in the willow leaves
     And on the dapplled grass,
     And still she's combing her long hair
     Before the looking-glass.

     I pray you, cease to comb out,
     Comb out your long hair,
     For I have heard of witchery
     Under a pretty air,

     That makes as one thing to the lover
     Staying and going hence,
     All fair, with many a pretty air
     And many a negligence.




XXV

     Lightly come or lightly go:
     Though thy heart presage thee woe,
     Vales and many a wasted sun,
     Oread let thy laughter run,
     Till the irreverent mountain air
     Ripple all thy flying hair.

     Lightly, lightly--ever so:
     Clouds that wrap the vales below
     At the hour of evenstar
     Lowliest attendants are;
     Love and laughter song-confessed
     When the heart is heaviest.




XXVI

     Thou leanest to the shell of night,
     Dear lady, a divining ear.
     In that soft choiring of delight
     What sound hath made thy heart to fear?
     Seemed it of rivers rushing forth
     From the grey deserts of the north?

     That mood of thine
     Is his, if thou but scan it well,
     Who a mad tale bequeaths to us
     At ghosting hour conjurable--
     And all for some strange name he read
                In Purchas or in Holinshed.




XXVII

     Though I thy Mithridates were,
     Framed to defy the poison-dart,
     Yet must thou fold me unaware
     To know the rapture of thy heart,
     And I but render and confess
     The malice of thy tenderness.

     For elegant and antique phrase,
     Dearest, my lips wax all too wise;
     Nor have I known a love whose praise
     Our piping poets solemnize,
     Neither a love where may not be
     Ever so little falsity.




XXVIII

     Gentle lady, do not sing
     Sad songs about the end of love;
     Lay aside sadness and sing
     How love that passes is enough.

     Sing about the long deep sleep
     Of lovers that are dead, and how
     In the grave all love shall sleep:
     Love is aweary now.




XXIX

     Dear heart, why will you use me so?
     Dear eyes that gently me upbraid,
     Still are you beautiful--but O,
     How is your beauty raimented!

     Through the clear mirror of your eyes,
     Through the soft sigh of kiss to kiss,
     Desolate winds assail with cries
     The shadowy garden where love is.

     And soon shall love dissolved be
     When over us the wild winds blow--
     But you, dear love, too dear to me,
     Alas! why will you use me so?




XXX

     Love came to us in time gone by
     When one at twilight shyly played
     And one in fear was standing nigh--
     For Love at first is all afraid.

     We were grave lovers. Love is past
     That had his sweet hours many a one;
     Welcome to us now at the last
     The ways that we shall go upon.




XXXI

     O, it was out by Donnycarney
     When the bat flew from tree to tree
     My love and I did walk together;
     And sweet were the words she said to me.

     Along with us the summer wind
     Went murmuring--O, happily!--
     But softer than the breath of summer
     Was the kiss she gave to me.




XXXII

     Rain has fallen all the day.
     O come among the laden trees:
     The leav
