Israel had fought and Sennacherib boasted--that plain lighted now with a
yet deeper glow, as heaven, kindling to glory beyond glory of yet
fiercer spiritual flame, still restrained the power knit at last to the
relief of final revelation, and for the last time the voices sang....

PRAESTET FIDES SUPPLEMENTUM
SENSUUM DEFECTUI ....

... He was coming now, swifter than ever, the heir of temporal ages and
the Exile of eternity, the final piteous Prince of rebels, the creature
against God, blinder than the sun which paled and the earth that shook;
and, as He came, passing even then through the last material stage to
the thinness of a spirit-fabric, the floating circle swirled behind Him,
tossing like phantom birds in the wake of a phantom ship.... He was
coming, and the earth, rent once again in its allegiance, shrank and
reeled in the agony of divided homage....

... He was coming--and already the shadow swept off the plain and
vanished, and the pale netted wings were rising to the cheek; and the
great bell clanged, and the long sweet chord rang out--not more than
whispers heard across the pealing storm of everlasting praise....

.... GENITORI GENITOQUE
LAUS ET JUBILATIO
SALUS HONOR VIRTUS QUOQUE
SIT ET BENEDICTIO
PROCEDENTI AB UTROQUE
COMPAR SIT LAUDATIO.

and once more

PROCEDENTI AB UTROQUE
COMPAR SIT LAUDATIO ....

Then this world passed, and the glory of it.
