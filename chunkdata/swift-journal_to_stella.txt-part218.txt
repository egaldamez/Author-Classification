dith, Major-General Maccartney,
and Brigadier Philip Honeywood. They alleged that their offence only
amounted to drinking a health to the Duke of Marlborough, and confusion
to his enemies. But the Government said that an example must be made,
because various officers had dropped dangerous expressions about
standing by their General, Marlborough, who was believed to be aiming at
being made Captain General for life. For Maccartney see the Journal for
Nov. 15, 1712, seq. Meredith, who was appointed Adjutant-General of
the Forces in 1701, was made a Lieutenant-General in 1708. He saw much
service under William III., and Marlborough, and was elected M.P. for
Midhurst in 1709. He died in 1719 (Dalton's Army Lists, III. 181).
Honeywood entered the army in 1694; was at Namur; and was made a
Brigadier-General before 1711. After the accession of George I. he
became Colonel of a Regiment of Dragoons, and commanded a division at
Dettingen. At his death in 1752 he was acting as Governor of Portsmouth,
with the rank of General (Dalton, iv. 30).

14 Or "malkin"; a counterfeit, or scarecrow.

15 William Cadogan, Lieutenant-General and afterwards Earl Cadogan
(1675-1726), a great friend of Marlborough, was Envoy to the United
Provinces and Spanish Flanders. Cadogan retained the post of Lieutenant
to the Tower until 1715.

16 Earl Cadogan's father, Henry Cadogan, barrister, married Bridget,
daughter of Sir Hardresse Waller, and sister of Elizabeth, Baroness
Shelburne in her own right.

17 See Letter 5, note 30.

18 Cadogan married Margaretta, daughter of William Munter, Counsellor of
the Court of Holland.

19 Presumably the eldest son, William, who succeeded his father as
second Earl of Kerry in 1741, and died in 1747. He was at Eton and
Christ Church, Oxford, and was afterwards a Colonel in the Coldstream
Guards.

20 Henry Petty, third Lord Shelburne, who became Earl of Shelburne in
1719. His son predeceased him, without issue, and on Lord Shelburne's
death, in 1751, his honours became extinct. His daughter Anne also died
without issue.

21 The menagerie, which had been one of the sights of London, was
removed from the Tower in 1834. In his account of the Tory Fox Hunter
in No. 47 of the Freeholder, Addison says, "Our first visit was to the
lions."

22 Bethlehem Hospital, for lunatics, in Moorfields, was a popular
"sight" in the eighteenth century. Cf. the Tatler, No. 30: "On Tuesday
last I took three lads, who are under my guardianship, a rambling, in a
hackney coach, to show them the town: as the lions, the tombs, Bedlam."

23 The Royal Society met at Gresham College from 1660 to 1710. The
professors of the College lectured on divinity, civil law, astronomy,
music, geometry, rhetoric, and physic.

24 The most important of the puppet-shows was Powell's, in the Little
Piazza, Covent Garden, which is frequently mentioned in the Tatler.

25 The precise nature this negligent costume is not known, but it is
always decried by popular writers of the time.

26 Retched. Bacon has "Patients must not keck at them at the first."

27 Swift was born on November 30.

28 Mrs. De la Riviere Manley, daughter of Sir Roger Manley, and cousin
of John Manley, M.P., and Isaac Manley (see Letter 3, note 3), wrote
poems and plays, but is best known for her "Secret Memoirs and Manners
of Several Persons of Quality, of both sexes. From the New Atalantis,
1709," a book abounding in scandalous references to her contemporaries.
She was arrested in October, but was discharged in Feb. 1710. In
May 1710 she brought out a continuation of the New Atalantis, called
"Memoirs of Europe towards the Close of the Eighth Century." In June
1711 she became editress of the Tory Examiner, and wrote political
pamphlets with Swift's assistance. Afterwards she lived with Alderman
Barber, the printer, at whose office she died in 1724. In her will
she mentioned her "much honoured friend, the Dean of St. Patrick, Dr.
Swift."

29 "He seems to have written these words in a whim; for the sake of what
follows" (Deane Swift).

33 In a letter to the Rev. Dr. Tisdall, of Dec. 16, 1703, Swift said:
"I'll teach you a way to outwit Mrs. Johnson: it is a new-fashioned
way of being witty, and they call it a bite. You must ask a bantering
question, or tell some damned lie in a serious manner, and then she will
answer or speak as if you were in earnest; and then cry you, 'Madam,
there's a bite!' I would not have you undervalue this, for it is
the constant amusement in Court, and everywhere else among the great
people." See, too, the Tatler, No. 12, and Spectator, Nos. 47, 504: "In
a word, a Biter is one who thinks you a fool, because you do not think
him a knave."

34 See Letter 9, note 4.

35 "As I hope to be saved;" a favourite phrase in the Journal.

36 See Letter 7, note 12.

37 This statement receives some confirmation from a pamphlet published
in September 1710, called "A Condoling Letter to the Tatler: On Account
of the Misfortunes of Isaac Bickerstaf Esq., a Prisoner in the ---- on
Suspicion of Debt."
