the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely
Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached,
and a large number of Attendants.--An ordinary Genius might probably
have been embarrassed, in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party,
but Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the
immediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest
adjoining to the house. Their Construction was both simple and
elegant--A couple of old blankets, each supported by four sticks, gave
a striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in
overcoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus's most striking
Virtues.
