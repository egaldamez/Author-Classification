hat was no comfort to him now; for he did not know how
these persons had fared, nor where were their souls.

So he stood in the black darkness, knowing that he could not turn, with
the horror on him so heavy that he sweated as he told me of it, and with
the knowledge that something was approaching under the trees without
sound of step or breathing--he did not know whether it was man or beast
or fiend, he only knew that it was approaching. Yet he could not pray or
cry out.

Then he was aware that it had entered the little space where he stood,
and was even now within a hand's grasp. Yet he could not lift his hands
to ward it off, or to pray to God, or to bless himself.

Then he perceived that the thing--_negotium perambulans in tenebris_
["the Business that walketh about in the dark" (Ps. xc. 6.)]--was
formless, without hands to strike or mouth to bite him with, and that it
was all about him now, closing upon him. If there had been aught to
touch his body, wet lips to kiss his face, or fiery eyes to look into
his own, he would not have feared it with a thousandth part of the fear
that he had. It was that there was no shape or face, and that it sought
not his body but his soul. And when he understood that he gave a loud
cry and awoke, and knew, as in a mystery, that it was no dream, but
that he was indeed come to the place that he had seen, and that this
_negotium_ was at his soul's heart. [There is either an omission here
in the translation of Sir John's original MS., or else the transcriber
has dashed his pen down in horror, or sought to produce an impression
of it.]....

I find it impossible, my children, to make you understand in what state
he was; he could not make even me understand. I can only set down a
little of what he said.

First, he knew that he had lost God. It was not that there was no God,
but that he had lost Him of his own fault and sin. He was aware that in
all other places there was God and that the blessed reigned with Him,
but not in the place where he was, nor in his heart. In all men that
ever I have met there was a certain presence of God. As the apostle told
the men of Athens, _Ipsius enim et genus suum_; ["For we are also His
offspring" (Acts xvii. 28.)] and, again, _Non longe est ab unoquoque
nostrum_; ["He is not far from every one of us" (Acts xvii. 27.)] and
again, _In ipso vivimus, et movemur, et sumus_. ["In Him we live, and
we move, and we are" (Acts xvii. 28.)] I have not seen a man who had
not this knowledge, though maybe some, such as Turks and pagans, may
call it by another name. But until death, I think, all men, whatever
their sins or ignorance, live and move in God's Majesty. Hell, Master
Richard told me, is nothing less than the withdrawal of that presence,
with other torments superadded, but this is chief. Master Richard told
me that that black fire of hell rages wherever God is not; and that the
worm gnaws in all hearts that have lost Him, and know it to be by their
own fault--_maxima culpa_. ["the very great fault."]

There be a few men in this world--the Son of God derelict is their
prince--who are called to this supreme torment while they yet live--if
indeed that man may be said to live who is without God--and of this
company Master Richard was now made one.

It was with him now as he had dreamed. Where God is not, there can be no
communion with man, for the only reason by which one perceives another's
soul, or understands that it is the soul of a man and has a likeness to
his own, is that both are, in some measure, in God. If we were more holy
and wise we should understand for ourselves that this is so, and see,
too, why it is so, for He is eyes to the blind and ears to the deaf.
[I do not understand this at all. I wonder whether Sir John did as he
wrote it; I am quite sure that his flock did not.]

For Master Richard, then, there was no other person in the world. There
was that that fenced him from all living. Our Saviour Christ upon the
rood spoke to His Blessed Mother before His dereliction, but not again
afterwards. There was no more that He might say to her, or to His
cousin, John.

This, then, was the state in which Master Richard lay--that
_specialissimus_ of God Almighty, to whom the Divine Love and Majesty
was as breath to his nostrils, meat to his mouth, and water to his body.
I an say no more on that point.

As to the fault by which it seemed that he had come to that state, it
was the most terrible of all sins, which is Presumption. Holy Church
sets before us Humility as the chief of virtues, to shew us that
Presumption is the chief of vices. A man may be an adulterer or a
murderer or a sacrilegious person, and yet by Humility may find mercy.
But a man may be chaste and stainless in all his works, and a worshipper
of God, but without Humility he cannot come to glory. [Sir John proceeds
in this strain for several pages, illustrating his point by the cases of
Lucifer, Nabuchodonosor, Judas Iscariot, King Herod, and others.]....

Now the matter in which it seemed to Master Richard that he had sinned
the sin of Presumption was the old matter of the tidings he had borne to
