; her husband in 1753. Lord
Hyde became joint Vice-Treasurer for Ireland in 1710; hence his interest
with respect to Pratt's appointment.

12 See Letter 3, note 10.

13 Sir Paul Methuen (1672-1757), son of John Methuen, diplomatist and
Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Methuen was Envoy and Ambassador to Portugal
from 1697 to 1708, and was M.P. for Devizes from 1708 to 1710, and a
Lord of the Admiralty. Under George I. he was Ambassador to Spain, and
held other offices. Gay speaks of "Methuen of sincerest mind, as Arthur
grave, as soft as womankind," and Steele dedicated to him the seventh
volume of the Spectator. In his Notes on Macky's Characters, Swift calls
him "a profligate rogue... without abilities of any kind."

14 Sir James Montagu was Attorney-General from 1708 to Sept. 1710, when
he resigned, and was succeeded by Sir Simon Harcourt. Under George I.
Montagu was raised to the Bench, and a few months before his death in
1723 became Chief Baron of the Exchequer.

15 The turnpike system had spread rapidly since the Restoration, and
had already effected an important reform in the English roads. Turnpike
roads were as yet unknown in Ireland.

16 Ann Johnson, who afterwards married a baker named Filby.

17 An infusion of which the main ingredient was cowslip or palsy-wort.

18 William Legge, first Earl of Dartmouth (1672-1750), was St. John's
fellow Secretary of State. Lord Dartmouth seems to have been a plain,
unpretending man, whose ignorance of French helped to throw important
matters into St. John's hands.

19 Richard Dyot was tried at the Old Bailey, on Jan. 13, 1710-11, for
counterfeiting stamps, and was acquitted, the crime being found
not felony, but only breach of trust. Two days afterwards a bill of
indictment was found against him for high misdemeanour.

20 Sir Philip Meadows (1626-1718) was knighted in 1658, and was
Ambassador to Sweden under Cromwell. His son Philip (died 1757) was
knighted in 1700, and was sent on a special mission to the Emperor in
1707. A great-grandson of the elder Sir Philip was created Earl Manvers
in 1806.

21 Her eyes were weak.

22 The son of the Sir Robert Southwell to whom Temple had offered Swift
as a "servant" on his going as Secretary of State to Ireland in 1690.
Edward Southwell (1671-1730) succeeded his father as Secretary of
State for Ireland in 1702, and in 1708 was appointed Clerk to the Privy
Council of Great Britain. Southwell held various offices under George I.
and George II., and amassed a considerable fortune.

23 Nicholas Rowe (1674-1718), dramatist and poet laureate, and one of
the first editors of Shakespeare, was at this time under-secretary to
the Duke of Queensberry, Secretary of State for Scotland.

24 No. 238 contains Swift's "Description of a Shower in London."

25 This seems to be a vague allusion to the text, "Cast thy bread upon
the waters," etc.

26 Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723), the fashionable portrait-painter of
the period.

27 At the General election of 1710 the contest at Westminster excited
much interest. The number of constituents was large, and the franchise
low, all householders who paid scot and lot being voters. There were,
too, many houses of great Whig merchants, and a number of French
Protestants. But the High Church candidates, Cross and Medlicott,
were returned by large majorities, though the Whigs had chosen popular
candidates--General Stanhope, fresh from his successes in Spain, and Sir
Henry Dutton Colt, a Herefordshire gentleman.

28 Sir Andrew Fountaine (1676-1753), a distinguished antiquary, of an
old Norfolk family, was knighted by William III. in 1699, and inherited
his father's estate at Norfolk in 1706. He succeeded Sir Isaac Newton as
Warden of the Mint in 1727, and was Vice-Chamberlain to Queen Caroline.
He became acquainted with Swift in Ireland in 1707, when he went over as
Usher of the Black Rod in Lord Pembroke's Court.

29 See Letter 2, note 17. The Bishop was probably Dr. Moreton, Bishop of
Meath (see Journal, July 1, 1712).

30 The game of ombre--of Spanish origin--is described in Pope's Rape of
the Lock. See also the Compleat Gamester, 1721, and Notes and Queries,
April 8, 1871. The ace of spades, or Spadille, was always the first
trump; the ace of clubs (Basto) always the third. The second trump was
the worst card of the trump suit in its natural order, i.e. the seven in
red and the deuce in black suits, and was called Manille. If either of
the red suits was trumps, the ace of the suit was fourth trump (Punto).
Spadille, Manille, and Basto were "matadores," or murderers, as they
never gave suit.

31 See Letter 3, note 30,

32 In the Spectator, No. 337, there is a complaint from "one of the top
China women about town," of the trouble given by ladies who turn
over all the goods in a shop without buying anything. Sometimes they
cheapened tea, at others examined screens or tea-dishes.

33 The Right Hon. John Grubham Howe, M.P. for Gloucestershire, an
extreme Tory, had recently been appointed Paymaster of the Forces. He is
mentioned satirically as a patriot in sec. 9 of The Tale of a Tub.
