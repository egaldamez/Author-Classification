es lie thick upon the way
     Of memories.

     Staying a little by the way
     Of memories shall we depart.
     Come, my beloved, where I may
     Speak to your heart.




XXXIII

     Now, O now, in this brown land
     Where Love did so sweet music make
     We two shall wander, hand in hand,
     Forbearing for old friendship' sake,
     Nor grieve because our love was gay
     Which now is ended in this way.

     A rogue in red and yellow dress
     Is knocking, knocking at the tree;
     And all around our loneliness
     The wind is whistling merrily.
     The leaves--they do not sigh at all
     When the year takes them in the fall.

     Now, O now, we hear no more
     The vilanelle and roundelay!
     Yet will we kiss, sweetheart, before
     We take sad leave at close of day.
     Grieve not, sweetheart, for anything--
     The year, the year is gathering.




XXXIV

     Sleep now, O sleep now,
     O you unquiet heart!
     A voice crying "Sleep now"
     Is heard in my heart.

     The voice of the winter
     Is heard at the door.
     O sleep, for the winter
     Is crying "Sleep no more."

     My kiss will give peace now
     And quiet to your heart--
     Sleep on in peace now,
     O you unquiet heart!




XXXV

     All day I hear the noise of waters
     Making moan,
     Sad as the sea-bird is when, going
     Forth alone,
     He hears the winds cry to the water's
     Monotone.
     The grey winds, the cold winds are blowing
     Where I go.
     I hear the noise of many waters
     Far below.
     All day, all night, I hear them flowing
     To and fro.




XXXVI

     I hear an army charging upon the land,
     And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about their knees:
     Arrogant, in black armour, behind them stand,
     Disdaining the reins, with fluttering ships, the charioteers.
     They cry unto the night their battle-name:
     I moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laughter.
     They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,
     Clanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.
     They come shaking in triumph their long, green hair:
     They come out of the sea and run shouting by the shore.
     My heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair?
     My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone?
