Or his face is far too wan,
               Or there is that written in his eyes
                 Which none should look upon.

               So they kept us close till nigh on noon,
                 And then they rang the bell,
               And the warders with their jingling keys
                 Opened each listening cell,
               And down the iron stair we tramped,
                 Each from his separate Hell.

               Out into God's sweet air we went,
                 But not in wonted way,
               For this man's face was white with fear,
                 And that man's face was gray,
               And I never saw sad men who looked
                 So wistfully at the day.

               I never saw sad men who looked
                 With such a wistful eye
               Upon that little tent of blue
                 We prisoners called the sky,
               And at every happy cloud that passed
                 In such strange freedom by.

               But there were those amongst us all
                 Who walked with downcast head,
               And knew that, had each got his due,
                 They should have died instead:
               He had but killed a thing that lived,
                 Whilst they had killed the dead.

               For he who sins a second time
                 Wakes a dead soul to pain,
               And draws it from its spotted shroud
                 And makes it bleed again,
               And makes it bleed great gouts of blood,
                 And makes it bleed in vain!

               Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb
                 With crooked arrows starred,
               Silently we went round and round
                 The slippery asphalte yard;
               Silently we went round and round,
                 And no man spoke a word.

               Silently we went round and round,
                 And through each hollow mind
               The Memory of dreadful things
                 Rushed like a dreadful wind,
               And Horror stalked before each man,
                 And Terror crept behind.

               The warders strutted up and down,
                 And watched their herd of brutes,
               Their uniforms were spick and span,
                 And they wore their Sunday suits,
               But we knew the work they had been at,
                 By the quicklime on their boots.

               For where a grave had opened wide,
                 There was no grave at all:
               Only a stretch of mud and sand
                 By the hideous prison-wall,
               And a little heap of burning lime,
                 That the man should have his pall.

               For he has a pall, this wretched man,
                 Such as few men can claim:
               Deep down below a prison-yard,
                 Naked, for greater shame,
               He lies, with fetters on each foot,
                 Wrapt in a sheet of flame!

               And all the while the burning lime
                 Eats flesh and bone away,
               It eats the brittle bones by night,
                 And the soft flesh by day,
               It eats the flesh and bone by turns,
                 But it eats the heart alway.

               For three long years they will not sow
                 Or root or seedling there:
               For three long years the unblessed spot
                 Will sterile be and bare,
               And look upon the wondering sky
                 With unreproachful stare.

               They think a murderer's heart would taint
                 Each simple seed they sow.
               It is not true! God's kindly earth
                 Is kindlier than men know,
               And the red rose would but glow more red,
                 The white rose whiter blow.

               Out of his mouth a red, red rose!
                 Out of his heart a white!
               For who can say by what strange way,
                 Christ brings His will to light,
               Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore
                 Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?

               But neither milk-white rose nor red
                 May bloom in prison air;
               The shard, the pebble, and the flint,
                 Are what they give us there:
               For flowers have been known to heal
                 A common man's despair.

               So never will wine-red rose or white,
                 Petal by petal, fall
               On that stretch of mud and sand that lies
                 By the hideous prison-wall,
               To tell the men who tramp the yard
                 That God's Son died for all.

               Yet though the hideous prison-wall
                 Still hems him round and round,
               And a spirit may not walk by night
                 That is with fetters bound,
               And a spirit may but weep that lies
                 In such unholy ground,

               He is at peace- this wretched man-
