6, note 12.

11 William Diaper, son of Joseph Diaper of Bridgewater, was sent to
Balliol College, Oxford, in 1699, at the age of fourteen. He entered
the Church, and was curate at Brent, Somerset; but he died in 1717, aged
twenty-nine.

12 The Examiner (vol. ii. No. 15) complained of general bribery and
oppression on the part of officials and underlings in the public
service, especially in matters connected with the army; but the writer
said that the head (Lord Lansdowne) was just and liberal in his nature,
and easy in his fortune, and a man of honour and virtue.

13 Sealed documents given to show that a merchant's goods are entered.

14 Thomas Lawrence, First Physician to Queen Anne, and Physician-General
to the Army, died in 1714 (Gentleman's Magazine, 1815, ii. 17). His
daughter Elizabeth was second wife to Lord Mohun.

15 See Letter 17, note 11.

16 See Letter 26, note 2.

17 No officer named Newcomb appears in Dalton's Army Lists; but
the allusion to General Ross, further on in Letter 43, adds to the
probability that Swift was referring to one of the sons of Sir Thomas
Newcomen, Bart., who was killed at the siege of Enniskillen.
Beverley Newcomen (Dalton, iii. 52, iv. 60), who was probably Swift's
acquaintance, was described in a petition of 1706 as a Lieutenant
who had served at Killiecrankie, and had been in Major-General Ross's
regiment ever since 1695.

18 Atterbury.

19 Evidently a familiar quotation at the time. Forster reads,
incorrectly, "But the more I lite MD."

20 See Letter 41, note 5.

21 See Letter 12, note 1.

22 In 1681, Elizabeth, only daughter and heiress of John Ayres, of the
City of London, then aged about twenty, became the fourth and last wife
of Heneage Finch, Earl of Winchelsea, who died in 1689. She lived until
1745.

23 See Letter 23, note 17.

24 Enoch Sterne (see Letter 4, note 17).

25 Lieut.-Col. Robert Sterne was in Col. Frederick Hamilton's Regiment
in 1695.

26 Letter.

27 See Letter 13, note 10.

28 The title was, John Bull in his Senses: being the Second Part of Law
is a Bottomless Pit.

29 See Letter 36, note 6.

30 Cf. note 9 above. Forster reads "nautyas," when the words would mean
"as naughty as nine," apparently.

31 See note 19 above.

32 In 1549, James, second Earl of Arran, was made Duke of Chatelherault
by Henry II. of France. His eldest son died without issue; the second,
John, became first Marquis of Hamilton, and was great-grandfather of
Lady Anne Hamilton (Duchess of Hamilton), mother of the Duke of Swift's
Journal. The Earl of Abercorn, on the other hand, was descended from
Claud, third son of the Earl of Arran, but in the male line; and
his claim was therefore the stronger, according to the French law of
inheritance.

33 Madams.

34 This word is doubtful. Forster reads "cobbled."

35 A mistake, apparently, for "writing." The letter was begun on March
8.

36 Silly jade.

37 O Lord, what a clutter.

38 On the death of Dr. William Graham, Dean of Wells, it was reported
that Swift was to be his successor. Dr. Brailsford, however, received
the appointment.

39 Abel Roper (1665-1726), a Tory journalist, published, thrice weekly,
the Postboy, to which Swift sometimes sent paragraphs. Boyer (Political
State, 1711, p. 678) said that Roper was only the tool of a party;
"there are men of figure and distinction behind the curtain, who furnish
him with such scandalous reflections as they think proper to cast upon
their antagonists."

40 Joe Beaumont.

41 Beg your pardon, Madams, I'm glad you like your apron (see Letter 41,
note 18).

42 This word was smudged by Swift.

43 I cannot find Somers in contemporary lists of officials. Cf. Letter
30, note 16 and Letter 17, note 3.

44 Obliterated and doubtful.

45 Words obliterated and illegible. Forster reads, conjecturally, "Pray
send Pdfr the ME account that I may have time to write to Parvisol."




LETTER 44.

1 Addressed to "Mrs. Dingley," etc. Endorsed "Apr. 14."

2 "Is" (MS.).

3 The words after "yet" are partially obliterated.

4 See Letter 7, note 35.

5 John Cecil, sixth Earl of Exeter (died 1721).

6 See Letter 22, note 5.

7 Arbuthnot.

8 A resort of the Tories.

9 Deane Swift, a son of Swift's uncle Godwin, was a merchant in Lisbon.

10 Winces. Lyly says, "Rubbe there no more, least I winch."

11 Probably William Whiston, who was deprived of the Lucasian
professorship at Cambridge in 1710 for his heterodox views. Parliament
having offered a reward for the discovery of means of finding the
longitude, Whiston made several attempts (1714 and 1721).

12 Word obliterated.

13 Distilled water prepared with rosemary flowers. In Fielding's Joseph
Andrews, a lady gives up to a highway robber, in her fright, a silver
bottle which, the ruffian said, contained some of the best brandy he had
ever tasted; this she "afterwards assured the company was a mistake of
her maid, for that she had ordered her to fill the bottle with Hungary
water."

14 As I hope to be saved.

15 Added on the fourth page, as the letter was folded.


Letter 45.

1 Addressed to "Mrs. Johnson," etc. Endorsed "May 1st."

2 A kind of clover, used for soothing purposes.
