is new volume, which she calls "Human Work," is a
glorification of labor.

Charlotte Perkins Gilman has been writing a new book, entitled "Human
Work." It is the best thing that Mrs. Gilman has done, and it is meant
to focus all of her previous work, so to speak.

                                                 --_Tribune, Chicago._

In her latest volume, "Human Work," Charlotte Perkins Gilman places
herself among the foremost students and elucidators of the problem of
social economics.

                                               --_San Francisco Star._

It is impossible to overestimate the value of the insistence on the
social aspect of human affairs as Mrs. Gilman has outlined it.

This magazine carries Mrs. Gilman's best and newest work, her social
philosophy, verse, satire, fiction, ethical teaching, humor and opinion.

It stands for Humanness in Women and Men; for better methods in Child
Culture; for the New Ethics, the better Economics--the New World we
are to make, are making. The breadth of Mrs. Gilman's thought and her
power of expressing it have made her well-known in America and Europe
as a leader along lines of human improvement and a champion of woman.

THE FORERUNNER voices her thought and its messages are not only many,
but strong, true and vital.
