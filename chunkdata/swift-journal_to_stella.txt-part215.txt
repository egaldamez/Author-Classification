 He was a subscriber for a copy of the Tatler
on royal paper (Aitken, Life of Steele, i. 329, 330).

19 In The History of Vanbrugh's House, Swift described everyone as
hunting for it up and down the river banks, and unable to find it, until
at length they--

     "-- in the rubbish spy
      A thing resembling a goose pie."

Sir John Vanbrugh was more successful as a dramatist than as an
architect, though his work at Blenheim and elsewhere has many merits.

20 For the successes of the last campaign.

21 John Sheffield, third Earl of Mulgrave, was created Duke of
Buckingham and Normanby in 1703, and died in 1721. On Queen Anne's
accession he became Lord Privy Seal, and on the return of the Tories
to power in 1710 he was Lord Steward, and afterward (June 1710) Lord
President of the Council. The Duke was a poet, as well as a soldier
and statesman, his best known work being the Essay on Poetry. He was
Dryden's patron, and Pope prepared a collected edition of his works.

22 Laurence Hyde, created Earl of Rochester in 1682, died in 1711. He
was the Hushai of Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel, "the friend of David
in distress." In 1684 he was made Lord President of the Council, and on
the accession of James II., Lord Treasurer; he was, however, dismissed
in 1687. Under William III. Rochester was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, an
office he resigned in 1703; and in September 1710 he again became Lord
President. His imperious temper always stood in the way of popularity or
real success.

23 Sir Thomas Osborne, Charles II.'s famous Minister, was elevated to
the peerage in 1673, and afterwards was made successively Earl of Danby,
Marquis of Caermarthen, and Duke of Leeds. On Nov. 29, 1710, a few days
after this reference to him, the Duke was granted a pension of 3500
pounds a year out of the Post Office revenues. He died in July 1712,
aged eighty-one, and soon afterwards his grandson married Lord Oxford's
daughter.

24 This is, of course, a joke; Swift was never introduced at Court.

25 Captain Delaval (see Letter 5, note 6).

26 Admiral Sir Charles Wager (1666-1743) served in the West Indies from
1707 to 1709, and gained great wealth from the prizes he took. Under
George I. he was Comptroller of the Navy, and in 1733 he became First
Lord of the Admiralty, a post which he held until 1742.

29 Isaac Bickerstaff's "valentine" sent him a nightcap, finely wrought
by a maid of honour to Queen Elizabeth (Tatler, No. 141). The "nightcap"
was a periwig with a short tie and small round head, and embroidered
nightcaps were worn chiefly by members of the graver professions.

38 The bellman's accents. Cf. Pepys' Diary, Jan. 16, 1659-60: "I staid
up till the bellman came by with his bell just under my window as I
was writing of this very line, and cried, 'Past one of the clock, and a
cold, frosty, windy morning.'"




LETTER 9.

1 John Freind, M.D. (1675-1728), was a younger brother of the Robert
Freind, of Westminster School, mentioned elsewhere in the Journal.
Educated under Dr. Busby at Westminster, he was in 1694 elected a
student of Christ Church, where he made the acquaintance of Atterbury,
and supported Boyle against Bentley in the dispute as to the authorship
of the letters of Phalaris. In 1705 he attended the Earl of Peterborough
to Spain, and in the following year wrote a defence of that commander
(Account of the Earl of Peterborough's Conduct in Spain). A steady Tory,
he took a share in the defence of Dr. Sacheverell; and in 1723, when
M.P. for Launceston, he fell under the suspicion of the Government, and
was sent to the Tower. On the accession of George II., however, he came
into favour with the Court, and died Physician to the Queen.

2 See Letter 8, note 19.

3 St. John was thirty-two in October 1710. He had been Secretary at
War six years before, resigning with Harley in 1707. Swift repeats
this comparison elsewhere. Temple was forty-six when he refused a
Secretaryship of State in 1674.

4 Sir Henry St. John seems to have continued a gay man to the end of
his life. In his youth he was tried and convicted for the murder of
Sir William Estcourt in a duel (Scott). In 1716, after his son had been
attainted, he was made Viscount St. John. He died in 1742, aged ninety.

5 "Swift delighted to let his pen run into such rhymes as these, which
he generally passes off as old proverbs" (Scott). Many of the charming
scraps of "Old Ballads" and "Old Plays" at the head of Scott's own
chapters are in reality the result of his own imagination.

6 See Letter 3, note 18.

7 Sir Richard Levinge, Bart., had been Solicitor-General for Ireland
from 1704 to 1709, and was Attorney-General from 1711 to 1714.
Afterwards he was Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and
Chief-Justice of
