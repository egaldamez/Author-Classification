     My love is in a light attire
     Among the apple-trees,
     Where the gay winds do most desire
     To run in companies.

     There, where the gay winds stay to woo
     The young leaves as they pass,
     My love goes slowly, bending to
     Her shadow on the grass;

     And where the sky's a pale blue cup
     Over the laughing land,
     My love goes lightly, holding up
     Her dress with dainty hand.

     Who goes amid the green wood
     With springtide all adorning her?
     Who goes amid the merry green wood
     To make it merrier?

     Who passes in the sunlight
     By ways that know the light footfall?
     Who passes in the sweet sunlight
     With mien so virginal?

     The ways of all the woodland
     Gleam with a soft and golden fire--
     For whom does all the sunny woodland
     Carry so brave attire?

     O, it is for my true love
     The woods their rich apparel wear--
     O, it is for my own true love,
     That is so young and fair.




IX

     Winds of May, that dance on the sea,
     Dancing a ring-around in glee
     From furrow to furrow, while overhead
     The foam flies up to be garlanded,
     In silvery arches spanning the air,
     Saw you my true love anywhere?
     Welladay! Welladay!
     For the winds of May!
     Love is unhappy when love is away!




X

     Bright cap and streamers,
     He sings in the hollow:
     Come follow, come follow,
                All you that love.
     Leave dreams to the dreamers
     That will not after,
     That song and laughter
                Do nothing move.

     With ribbons streaming
     He sings the bolder;
     In troop at his shoulder
                The wild bees hum.
     And the time of dreaming
     Dreams is over--
     As lover to lover,
                Sweetheart, I come.




XI

     Bid adieu, adieu, adieu,
     Bid adieu to girlish days,
     Happy Love is come to woo
     Thee and woo thy girlish ways--
     The zone that doth become thee fair,
     The snood upon thy yellow hair,

     When thou hast heard his name upon
     The bugles of the cherubim
     Begin thou softly to unzone
     Thy girlish bosom unto him
     And softly to undo the snood
     That is the sign of maidenhood.




XII

     What counsel has the hooded moon
     Put in thy heart, my shyly sweet,
     Of Love in ancient plenilune,
     Glory and stars beneath his feet--
     A sage that is but kith and kin
     With the comedian Capuchin?

     Believe me rather that am wise
     In disregard of the divine,
     A glory kindles in those eyes
     Trembles to starlight. Mine, O Mine!
     No more be tears in moon or mist
     For thee, sweet sentimentalist.




XIII

     Go seek her out all courteously,
     And say I come,
     Wind of spices whose song is ever
     Epithalamium.
     O, hurry over the dark lands
     And run upon the sea
     For seas and lands shall not divide us
     My love and me.

     Now, wind, of your good courtesy
     I pray you go,
     And come into her little garden
     And sing at her window;
     Singing: The bridal wind is blowing
     For Love is at his noon;
     And soon will your true love be with you,
     Soon, O soon.




XIV

     My dove, my beautiful one,
     Arise, arise!
     The night-dew lies
     Upon my lips and eyes.

     The odorous winds are weaving
     A music of sighs:
     Arise, arise,
     My dove, my beautiful one!

     I wait by the cedar tree,
     My sister, my love,
     White breast of the dove,
     My breast shall be your bed.

     The pale dew lies
     Like a veil on my head.
     My fair one, my fair dove,
     Arise, arise!




XV

     From dewy dreams, my soul, arise,
     From love's deep slumber and from death,
     For lo! the trees are full of sighs
     Whose leaves the morn admonisheth.

     Eastward the gradual dawn prevails
     Where softly-burning fires appear,
     Making to tremble all those veils
     Of grey and golden gossamer.

     While sweetly, gently, secretly,
     The flowery bells of morn are stirred
     And the wise choirs of faery
     Begin (innumerous!) to be heard.




XVI

     O cool is the valley now
     And there, love, will we go
     For many a choir is singing now
     Where Love did sometime go.
     And hear you not the thrushes calling,
     Calling us away?
     O cool and pleasant is the valley
     And there, love, will we stay.




XVII

     Because your voice was at my side
     I gave him pain,
     Because within my hand I held
     Your hand again.

     There is no word nor any sign
     Can make amend--
     He is a stranger to me now
     Who was my friend.




XVIII

     O Sweetheart, hear you
     Your lover's tale;
     A man shall have sorrow
     When friends him fail.

     For he shall know then
     Friends be untrue
     And a little ashes
     Their words come to.

     But one unto him
     Will softly move
     And softly woo him
     In ways of love.

     His hand is under
     Her smooth round breast;
     So he who has sorrow
     Shall have rest.




XIX

     Be not sad because all
