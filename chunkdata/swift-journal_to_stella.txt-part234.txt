some of his own servants in April 1712, at the age of seventy-three. His

1 Swift's verses, "The Description of a Salamander," are a scurrilous

bravery. Joanna Cutts, the sister who complained of Swift's abuse, died
unmarried.

10 The Countess of Jersey (see Letter 30, note 6), like her husband, was
a friend of Bolingbroke's. Lady Strafford speaks of her having lately
(November 1711) "been in pickle for her sins," at which she was not
surprised. Before the Earl succeeded to the title, Lady Wentworth wrote
to her son: "It's said Lord Villors Lady was worth fower scoar thoussand
pd; you might have got her, as wel as Lord Villors.... He (Lord Jersey)
has not don well by his son, the young lady is not yoused well as I hear
amongst them, which in my openion is not well." Wentworth Papers (pp.
