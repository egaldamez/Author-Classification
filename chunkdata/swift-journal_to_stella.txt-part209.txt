shire, and niece of Sir Isaac Newton. She was a favourite
among the toasts of the Kit-Cat Club, and Lord Halifax, who left her
a fortune, was an intimate friend. In 1717 she married John Conduitt,
afterwards Master of the Mint.

16 William Connolly, appointed a Commissioner of the Revenue in 1709,
was afterwards Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. He died in 1729.
Francis Robarts, appointed a Commissioner of the Revenue in 1692, was
made a Teller of the Exchequer in England in 1704, and quitted that
office, in September 1710, on his reappointment, in Connolly's place,
as Revenue Commissioner in Ireland. In 1714 Robarts was removed, and
Connolly again appointed Commissioner.

17 Enoch Sterne, Collector of Wicklow and Clerk to the Irish House of
Lords. Writing to Dr. Sterne on Sept. 26, Swift said, "I saw Collector
Sterne, who desired me to present his service to you, and to tell you he
would be glad to hear from you, but not about business."

18 In his "Character of Mrs. Johnson" Swift says, "She was never known
to cry out, or discover any fear, in a coach." The passage in the text
is obscure. Apparently Esther Johnson had boasted of saving money by
walking, instead of riding, like a coward.

19 John Radcliffe (1650-1714), the well-known physician and wit, was
often denounced as a clever empiric. Early in 1711 he treated Swift for
his dizziness. By his will, Radcliffe left most of his property to the
University of Oxford.

20 Charles Barnard, Sergeant-Surgeon to the Queen, and Master of the
Barber Surgeons' Company. His large and valuable library, to which Swift
afterwards refers, fetched great prices. Luttrell records Barnard's
death in his diary for Oct. 12, 1710.

21 Robert Harley, afterwards Earl of Oxford, had been appointed
Chancellor of the Exchequer in August 1710. In May 1711 he was raised to
the peerage and made Lord High Treasurer; and he is constantly referred
to in the Journal as "Lord Treasurer." He was impeached in 1715, but was
acquitted to 1717; he died in 1724.

22 The Right Hon. Thomas Bligh, M.P., of Rathmore, County Meath, died on
Aug. 28, 1710. His son, mentioned later in the Journal, became Earl of
Darnley.

2 Erasmus Lewis, Under Secretary of State under Lord Dartmouth, was a
great friend of Swift, Pope, and Arbuthnot. He had previously been one
of Harley's secretaries, and in his Horace Imitated, Book I. Ep. vii.,
Swift describes him as "a cunning shaver, and very much in Harley's
favour." Arbuthnot says that under George I. Lewis kept company with
the greatest, and was "principal governor" in many families. Lewis was
a witness to Arbuthnot's will. Pope and Esther Vanhomrigh both left him
money to buy rings. Lewis died in 1754, aged eighty-three.

3 Charles Darteneuf, or Dartiquenave, was a celebrated epicure, who is
said to have been a son of Charles II. Lord Lyttleton, in his Dialogues
of the Dead, recalling Pope's allusions to him, selects him to represent
modern bon vivants in the dialogue between Darteneuf and Apicius. See
Tatler 252. Darteneuf was Paymaster of the Royal Works and a member of
the Kit-Cat Club. He died in 1737.

6 Captain George Delaval, appointed Envoy Extraordinary to the King of
Portugal in Oct, 1710, was with Lord Peterborough in Spain in 1706. In
May 1707 he went to Lisbon with despatches for the Courts of Spain
and Portugal, from whence he was to proceed as Envoy to the Emperor of
Morocco, with rich presents (Luttrell, vi. 52, 174, 192).

7 Charles Montagu, Earl of Halifax, as Ranger of Bushey Park and Hampton
Court, held many offices under William III., and was First Lord of
the Treasury under George I., until his death in 1715. He was great as
financier and as debater, and he was a liberal patron of literature.

8 John Manley, M.P. for Bossiney, was made Surveyor-General on Sept. 30,
1710, and died in 1714. In 1706 he fought a duel with another Cornish
member (Luttrell, vi. 11, 535, 635). He seems to be the cousin whom Mrs.
De la Riviere Manley accuses of having drawn her into a false marriage.

9 The Earl of Godolphin (see Letter 2, note 3).

10 Sir John Stanley, Bart., of Northend, Commissioner of Customs, whom
Swift knew through his intimate friends the Pendarves. His wife, Anne,
daughter of Bernard Granville, and niece of John, Earl of Bath, was aunt
to Mary Granville, afterwards Mrs. Delany, who lived with the Stanleys
at their house in Whitehall.

11 Henry, Viscount Hyde, eldest son of Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester,
succeeded his father in the earldom in 1711, and afterwards became Earl
of Clarendon. His wife, Jane, younger daughter of Sir William Leveson
Gower,--who married a daughter of John Granville, Earl of Bath,--was
a beauty, and the mother of two beauties--Jane, afterwards Countess of
Essex (see journal, Jan. 29, 1712), and Catherine, afterwards Countess
of Queensberry. Lady Hyde was complimented by Prior, Pope, and her
kinsman, Lord Lansdowne, and is said to have been more handsome than
either of her daughters. She died in 1725
