elieved if he had
not told me, and that was a ring of bulls in a clearing that tossed
something this way and that, one to the other: he drove them off, and
found that it was a hare, not yet dead, but it died in his hands. He
told me that this verse came to his mind as he laid the poor beast down
under a tree; _Circumdederunt me vituli multi: tauri pingues obsederunt
me_, ["Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me"
(Ps. xxi. 13)] and there is no wonder in that, for it is from a psalm of
the passion, and it was what befell him afterwards, as you shall hear.

Soon after that he bathed himself in a pool, for he was hot with
walking, and desired to be at his ease when he saw folk again; and he
dipped his sandals, too, to cool them.

Then he went in his white kirtle a little, until his hair was dried, and
when the heat of the day began to turn he was aware that he was coming
near to a village, for there was a herd of pigs that looked on him
without fear.

The village was a very little one, but it stood upon a road, and here
he had his first sight of the town-folks, for as he rested by a gate a
company of fellows went by from the wars. I suppose that they were
lately come from France (maybe from Arfleet [that is, Harfleur]), for
he told me that there were pavissors among them--the men with the great
shields called pavices which are used only in sieges from the wooden
castles that they push against the walls of the town. They were stained
with travel, too, and were very silent and peevish. There were all
sorts there besides the pavissors--the men-at-arms in their plate
and mail-shirts, the archers in their body-armour and aprons, and
the glaivemen [Glaives were a kind of pike, but with long carved
cutting-blades. Bills had straight blades.] with the rest. He said that
one company that rode in front had the sign of the Ragged Staff upon
their breasts, by which he learned afterwards that they were my lord
Warwick's men. [The Ragged Staff was the emblem of Lord Warwick.]

One cried out to him to know how far was it to London, but he shook his
head and said that he was a stranger. The fellow jeered and named him
bumpkin, but the rest said nothing, and looked on him as they passed,
and two at the end doffed their caps. They were about two hundred, and
one rode in front with a banner borne before him; but it was a still hot
day, and Master Richard could not see the device, for the folds hung
about the staff.

He saw other folks after that here and there, although he avoided the
villages where he could; but he got no supper, and an hour before sunset
he came to the ferry over against Westminster. The wherries were drawn
up on the beach, and he came down to these past Lambeth House, wondering
how he was to get over.

He besought one man for the love of Jesu to take him over, but he would
not; and another for the love of Mary, and a third for the sake of the
Rood of Bromholm, [a famous relic of the True Cross.] and a fourth for
the love of saint Anthony. And at that they laughed at him, coming round
him and looking on him curiously, and crying that they would have all the
saints out of him before _Avemaria_, and asking to know his business.
When he told them in his simplicity that he was to see the King, they
laughed the more, and said that the King was gone to be a monk at saint
Edmond's, and that he had best look for him there.

Then he asked yet another, a great fellow with a hairy face and chest,
to take him over for the love of saint Denis and saint Giles, and the
fellow swore a great oath, elbowed his way out of the press that were
all staring and laughing, and bade him follow.

So he got into the boat and sat there while the man carried down the
oars, and all the rest crowded to look and question and mock. He told me
that he supposed at the time that all the folks looked at him for that
they were not used to see solitaries, but I do not think it was that. I
tell you that one who looked a little on Master Richard would look long,
and that one who looked long must either laugh or weep, so surprising
was his beauty and his simplicity.

When they were half-way over the fellow told him which was the abbey
church, and Master Richard said that he knew it, for that he had seen it
four years before when he came under our Lord's hand from Cambridge, and
that he would ask shelter from the monks.

"And there is an ankret [an ankret was a solitary, confined to one cell
with episcopal ceremonies.], is there not?" asked Master Richard.

The man told him Yes, looking upon him curiously, and he told him, too,
where was his cell. Then he put him on shore without a word, save asking
for his prayers.

I cannot tell you how Master Richard came to the ankret's cell, for I
was only at Westminster once when Master Richard went to his reward,
but he found his way there, marvelling at the filth of the ways, and
looked in through the little window, drawing himself up to it by the
strength of his arms.

It was all dark within, he told me, and a stench as of a kennel came up
from the darkness.

He called
