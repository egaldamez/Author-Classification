er many adventures in Europe, with a
recommendation from the Duke of Savoy. Godolphin gave him the command
of a regiment of refugees, and employed him in projects for effecting a
landing in France. These schemes proving abortive, Guiscard's regiment
was disbanded, and he was discharged with a pension of 500 pounds
a year. Soon after the Tories came to power Guiscard came to the
conclusion that there was no hope of employment for him, and
little chance of receiving his pension; and he began a treacherous
correspondence with the French. When this was detected he was brought
before the Privy Council, and finding that everything was known, and
wishing a better death than hanging, he stabbed Harley in the breast.
Mrs. Manley, under Swift's directions, wrote a Narrative of Guiscard's
Examination, and the incident greatly added to the security of Harley's
position, and to the strength of the Government.

23 Harley's surgeon, Mr. Green.

24 See Letter 9, note 20.

25 Mrs. Walls' baby (see Feb 5, 1711).

26 The phrase had its origin in the sharp practices in the horse and
cattle markets. Writing to Arbuthnot in 1727, Swift said that Gay "had
made a pretty good bargain (that is a Smithfield) for a little place in
the Custom House."

27 "There."

1 See Swift's paper in the Examiner, No. 32, and Mrs. Manley's pamphlet,
already mentioned.

2 Presumably Mrs. Johnson's palsy-water (see Letter 5, note 17).

3 Thomas Wentworth, Baron Raby (1672-1739), was created Viscount
Wentworth and Earl of Strafford in June 1711. Lord Raby was Envoy and
Ambassador at Berlin for some years, and was appointed Ambassador at
the Hague in March 1711. In November he was nominated as joint
Plenipotentiary with the Bishop of Bristol to negotiate the terms of
peace. He objected to Prior as a colleague; Swift says he was "as
proud as hell." In 1715 it was proposed to impeach Strafford, but the
proceedings were dropped. In his later years he was, according to Lord
Hervey, a loquacious and illiterate, but constant, speaker in the House
of Lords.

4 A beauty, to whom Swift addressed verses in 1708. During the frost of
January 1709 Swift wrote: "Mrs. Floyd looked out with both her eyes, and
we had one day's thaw; but she drew in her head, and it now freezes as
hard as ever." She was a great friend of Lady Betty Germaine's.

5 Swift never had the smallpox.

6 See Letter 12, note 22.

7 Heart.

8 The first number of the Spectator appeared on March 1, 1711.

9 In one of his poems Swift speaks of Stella "sossing in an easy-chair."

10 See Letter 4, note 20.

11 "It is reasonable to suppose that Swift's acquaintance with Arbuthnot
commenced just about this time; for in the original letter Swift
misspells his name, and writes it Arthbuthnet, in a clear large hand,
that MD might not mistake any of the letters" (Deane Swift). Dr. John
Arbuthnot had been made Physician in Ordinary to the Queen; he was one
of Swift's dearest friends.

12 Clobery Bromley, M.P. for Coventry, son of William Bromley, M.P. (see
Letter 10, note 1), died on March 20, 1711, and Boyer (Political State,
i. 255) says that the House, "out of respect to the father, and to give
him time, both to perform the funeral rites and to indulge his just
affliction," adjourned until the 26th.

13 See Letter 5, note 4.

14 See Letter 17, note 11.

15 Sir John Perceval, Bart. (died 1748), was created Baron Perceval
1715, Viscount Perceval 1722, and Earl of Egmont 1733, all in the Irish
peerage. He married, in 1710, Catherine, eldest daughter of Sir Philip
Parker A'Morley, Bart., of Erwarton, Suffolk; and his son (born Feb. 27,
1710-11) was made Baron Perceval and Holland, in the English peerage, in
1762.

16 This report was false. The Old Pretender did not marry until 1718,
when he was united to the Princess Clementina Maria, daughter of Prince
James Sobieski.


Letter 19.

1 John Hartstonge, D.D. (died 1717), was Bishop of Ossory from 1693 to
1714, when he was translated to Derry.

2 See Letter 15, note 16.

3 Thomas Proby was Chirurgeon-General in Ireland from 1699 until his
death in 1761. In his Short Character of Thomas, Earl of Wharton, Swift
speaks of him as "a person universally esteemed," who had been badly
treated by Lord Wharton. In 1724 Proby's son, a captain in the army, was
accused of popery, and Swift wrote to Lord Carteret that the charge
was generally believed to be false: "The father is the most universally
beloved of any man I ever knew in his station.... You cannot do
any personal thing more acceptable to the people of Ireland than
in inclining towards lenity to Mr. Proby and his family." Proby was
probably a near relative of Sir Thomas Proby, Bart., M.P., of Elton,
Hunts, at whose death in 1689 the baronetcy expired. Mrs. Proby seems to
have been a Miss Spencer.

4 Meliora, daughter of Thomas Coningsby, Baron of Clanbrassil and
Earl of Coningsby, and wife of Sir Thomas Southwell, afterwards Baron
Southwell, one of the Commissioners of Revenue in Ireland, and a member
of the Irish Privy Council. Lady Southwell died in 1736.

5 Lady Betty Rochfort was the daughter of Henry Moore, third E
