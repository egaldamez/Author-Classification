5 By his will Swift left to Deane Swift his "large silver standish,
consisting of a large silver plate, an ink-pot, and a sand-box."

6 I.e., we are only three hours in getting there.

8 The Examiner was revived in December 1711, under Oldisworth's
editorship, and was continued by him until 1714.

9 James Douglas, fourth Duke of Hamilton, was created Duke of Brandon in
the English peerage in September 1711, and was killed by Lord Mohun in
a duel in 1712. Swift calls him "a worthy good-natured person, very
generous, but of a middle understanding." He married, in 1698, as his
second wife, Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Digby, Lord Gerard, a
lady to whom Swift often refers in the Journal. She outlived the Duke
thirty-two years.

10 See August 27th, 1711.

11 William Fitzmaurice (see Letter 11, note 19).

12 The Duke of Shrewsbury (see Letter 3, note 32) married an Italian
lady, Adelhida, daughter of the Marquis of Paliotti, of Bologna,
descended maternally from Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Queen
Elizabeth's favourite. Lady Cowper (Diary, pp. 8, 9) says that the
Duchess "had a wonderful art of entertaining and diverting people,
though she would sometimes exceed the bounds of decency;... but then,
with all her prate and noise, she was the most cunning, designing woman
alive, obliging to people in prosperity, and a great party-woman." As
regards the name "Presto," see Letter 2, note 11.

13 Probably a cousin.

14 Presumptuous: claiming much.

15 See Letter 13, note 15. John Winchcombe, a weaver of Newbury, marched
with a hundred of his workmen, at his own expenses, against the Scots in
1513.

16 Thomas Coke, M.P., of Derbyshire, was appointed a Teller of the
Exchequer in 1704, and Vice-Chamberlain to the Queen in 1706. In 1706
he married--as his second wife--Mrs. Hale, one of the maids of honour
(Luttrell, v. 411, 423; vi. 113, 462; Lady Cowper's Diary, 15, 16), a
lady whose "piercing" beauty it was, apparently, that Steele described
under the name of Chloe, in No. 4 of the Tatler. Jervas painted her as
a country girl, "with a liveliness that shows she is conscious, but not
affected, of her perfections." Coke was the Sir Plume of Pope's Rape of
the Lock.

17 The committee of management of the Royal household.

18 Francesca Margherita de l'Epine, the famous singer, and principal
rival of Mrs. Tofts, came to England in 1692, and constantly sang in
opera until her retirement in 1718, when she married Dr. Pepusch. She
died in 1746. Her sister, Maria Gallia, also a singer, did not attain
the same popularity.

19 Charles Scarborow and Sir William Foster were the Clerks of the Board
of Green Cloth.

20 See Letter 27, note 16 on Thomas Coke.

21 The Earl of Sunderland's second wife, Lady Anne Churchill, who died
in 1716, aged twenty-eight. She was the favourite daughter of the Duke
of Marlborough, and was called "the little Whig." Verses were written in
honour of her beauty and talent by Charles Montagu, Earl of Halifax, Dr.
Watts and others, and her portrait was painted by Lely and Kneller.

22 Mary, daughter of Sir William Forester, of Dothill, Shropshire.
In 1700, at the age of thirteen, she had been secretly married to her
cousin, George Downing, a lad of fifteen. Three years later, Downing,
on his return from abroad, refused to acknowledge his wife, and in 1715
both parties petitioned the House of Lords for leave to bring in a
Bill declaring the marriage to be void; but leave was refused (Lords'
Journals, xx. 41, 45). Downing had become Sir George Downing, Bart., in
1711, and had been elected M.P. for Dunwich; he died without issue in
1749, and was the founder of Downing College, Cambridge.

23 In a discussion upon what would be the result if beards became the
fashion, Budgell (Spectator, No. 331) says, "Besides, we are not certain
that the ladies would not come into the mode, when they take the air
on horseback. They already appear in hats and feathers, coats and
periwigs."




LETTER 28.

1 Horse-racing was much encouraged by Charles II., who, as Strutt tells
us, appointed races to be made in Datchet Mead, when he was residing
at Windsor. By Queen Anne's time horse-racing was becoming a regular
institution: see Spectator, No. 173.
