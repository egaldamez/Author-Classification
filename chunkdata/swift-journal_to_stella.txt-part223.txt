which is the one referred to by
Swift. Possibly he was the Edmund Fielding--grandson of the first
Earl of Denbigh--who died a Lieutenant-General in 1741, at the age of
sixty-three, but is best known as the father of Henry Fielding, the
novelist.

22 Cf. Feb. 17, 1711.

23 See Letter 3, note 37.

24 "It is a measured mile round the outer wall; and far beyond any the
finest square in London" (Deane Swift).

25 "The common fare for a set-down in Dublin" (ib.).

26 "Mrs. Stoyte lived at Donnybrook, the road to which from Stephen's
Green ran into the country about a mile from the south-east corner"
(ib.).

27 "Those words in italics are written in a very large hand, and so
is the word large" (ib.). (Italics replaced by capitals for the
transcription of this etext.)

28 Deane Swift alters "lele" to "there," but in a note states how he
here altered Swift's "cypher way of writing." No doubt "lele" and other
favourite words occurred frequently in the MS., as they do in the later
letters.




LETTER 17.

1 Sir Thomas Mansel, Bart., Comptroller of the Household to Queen Anne,
and a Lord of the Treasury, was raised to the peerage in December 1711
as Baron Mansel of Margam. He died in 1723.

2 Lady Betty Butler and Lady Betty Germaine (see Letter 3, note 40 and
Letter 4, note 3).

3 James Eckershall, "second clerk of the Queen's Privy Kitchen."
Chamberlayne (Magnae Britanniae Notitia, 1710, p. 536) says that his
wages were 11 pounds, 8 shillings and a penny-ha'penny, and board-wages
138 pounds, 11 shillings and tenpence-ha'penny, making 150 pounds in
all. Afterwards Eckershall was gentleman usher to Queen Anne; he died at
Drayton in 1753, aged seventy-four. Pope was in correspondence with him
in 1720 on the subject of contemplated speculations in South Sea and
other stocks.

4 In October 1710 (see Letter 6, note 44) Swift wrote as if he knew
about the preparation of these Miscellanies. The volume was published
by Morphew instead of Tooke, and it is frequently referred to in the
Journal.

5 In 1685 the Duke of Ormond (see Letter 2, note 10) married, as his
second wife, Lady Mary Somerset, eldest surviving daughter of Henry,
first Duke of Beaufort.

6 Arthur Moore, M.P., was a Commissioner of Trade and Plantations from
1710 until his death in 1730. Gay calls him "grave," and Pope ("Prologue
to the Satires," 23) says that Moore blamed him for the way in which his
"giddy son," James Moore Smythe, neglected the law.

7 James, Lord Paisley, who succeeded his father (see Letter 10, note
33) as seventh Earl of Abercorn in 1734, married, in 1711, Anne, eldest
daughter of Colonel John Plumer, of Blakesware, Herts.

8 Harley's ill-health was partly due to his drinking habits.

9 Crowd or confusion.

10 The first wife of Charles Seymour, sixth Duke of Somerset, was
Lady Elizabeth Percy, only daughter of Joscelyn, eleventh Earl of
Northumberland, and heiress of the house of Percy. She married the Duke,
her third husband, at the age of eighteen.

11 John Richardson, D.D., rector of Armagh, Cavan, and afterwards
chaplain to the Duke of Ormond. In 1711 he published a Proposal for the
Conversion of the Popish Natives of Ireland to the Established Religion,
and in 1712 a Short History of the Attempts to Convert the Popish
Natives of Ireland. In 1709 the Lower House of Convocation in Ireland
had passed resolutions for printing the Bible and liturgy in Irish,
providing Irish preachers, etc. In 1711 Thomas Parnell, the poet, headed
a deputation to the Queen on the subject, when an address was presented;
but nothing came of the proposals, owing to fears that the English
interest in Ireland might be injured. In 1731 Richardson was given the
small deanery of Kilmacluagh.

12 See Feb. 27, 1711.

13 Harley.

14 "Bank bill for fifty pound," taking the alternate letters (see Letter
15, note 9).

15 See Letter 5, note 17.

16 See Nos. 27 and 29, by Swift himself.

17 "Print cannot do justice to whims of this kind, as they depend wholly
upon the awkward shape of the letters" (Deane Swift).

18 See Letter 8, note 2.

19 "Here is just one specimen given of his way of writing to Stella in
these journals. The reader, I hope, will excuse my omitting it in all
other places where it occurs. The meaning of this pretty language is:
'And you must cry There, and Here, and Here again. Must you imitate
Presto, pray? Yes, and so you shall. And so there's for your letter.
Good-morrow'" (Deane Swift). What Swift really wrote was probably as
follows: "Oo must cly Lele and Lele and Lele aden. Must oo mimitate
Pdfr, pay? Iss, and so oo sall. And so lele's fol oo rettle.
Dood-mallow."

20 Lady Catherine Morice (died 1716) was the eldest daughter of Thomas
Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, and wife of Sir Nicholas Morice, Bart., M.P.
for Newport.

21 Perhaps Henry Arundell, who succeeded his father as fifth Baron
Arundell of Wardour in 1712, and died in 1726.

22 Antoine, Abbe de Bourlie and Marquis de Guiscard, was a cadet of a
distinguished family of the south of France. He joined the Church,
but having been driven from France in consequence of his licentious
excesses, he came to England, aft
