r. Lambert, chaplain to Lord Wharton, was censured in Convocation
for being the author of a libellous letter.

39 Probably the same person as Dr. Griffith, spoken of in the Journal
for March 3, 1713,--when he was ill,--as having been "very tender of"
Stella.

40 See Letter 9, note 22.

41 Vexed, offended. Elsewhere Swift wrote, "I am apt to grate the ears
of more than I could wish."

42 Ambrose Philips, whose Pastorals had been published in the same
volume of Tonson's Miscellany as Pope's. Two years later Swift wrote,
"I should certainly have provided for him had he not run party mad." In
1712 his play, The Distrest Mother, received flattering notice in the
Spectator, and in 1713, to Pope's annoyance, Philips' Pastorals were
praised in the Guardian. His pretty poems to children led Henry Carey to
nickname him "Namby Pamby."

43 An equestrian statue of William III., in College Green, Dublin. It
was common, in the days of party, for students of the University of
Dublin to play tricks with this statue.

44 Lieutenant-General Richard Ingoldsby (died 1712) was Commander of the
Forces in Ireland, and one of the Lords Justices in the absence of the
Lord Lieutenant.

45 This seems to have been a mistake; cf. Journal for July 13, 1711,
Alan Brodrick, afterwards Viscount Midleton, a Whig politician and
lawyer, was made Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in Ireland in 1709,
but was removed from office in June 1711, when Sir Richard Cox succeeded
him. On the accession of George I. he was appointed Lord Chancellor
for Ireland. Afterwards he declined to accept the dedication to him of
Swift's Drapiers Letters, and supported the prosecution of the author.
He died in 1728.

46 Robert Doyne was appointed Chief Baron of the Exchequer in Ireland
in 1695, and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1703. This appointment
was revoked on the accession of George I.

47 See Letter 9, note 12.

48 Of the University of Dublin.

49 See Letter 2, note 18 and Letter 3, note 4. Sir Thomas Frankland's
eldest son, Thomas, who afterwards succeeded to the baronetcy, acquired
a fortune with his first wife, Dinah, daughter of Francis Topham, of
Agelthorpe, Yorkshire. He died in 1747.

50 See Letter 8, note 21.

51 see Letter 4, note 15.

52 Mary, daughter of Sir John Williams, Bart., and widow of Charles
Petty, second Lord Shelburne, who died in 1696. She had married, as
her second husband, Major-General Conyngham, and, as her third husband,
Colonel Dallway.

53 Dr. John Vesey became Bishop of Limerick in 1672, and Archbishop of
Tuam in 1678. He died in 1716.

54 See Letter 3, note 39.

55 Sex.

56 Toby Caulfeild, third son of the fifth Lord Charlemont. In 1689 he
was Colonel to the Earl of Drogheda's Regiment of Foot, and about 1705
he succeeded to the command of Lord Skerrin's Regiment of Foot. After
serving in Spain his regiment was reduced, having lost most of its men
(Luttrell, vi. 158).

57 John Campbell, second Duke of Argyle (1680-1743), was installed a
Knight of the Garter in December 1710, after he had successfully opposed
a vote of thanks to Marlborough, with whom he had quarrelled. It was of
this nobleman that Pope wrote-- "Argyle, the State's whole thunder born
to wield,      And shake alike the senate and the field."
In a note to Macky's Memoirs, Swift describes the Duke as an "ambitious,
covetous, cunning Scot, who had no principle but his own interests and
greatness."

58 Harley's second wife, Sarah, daughter of Simon Middleton, of
Edmonton, and sister of Sir Hugh Middleton, Bart. She died, without
issue, in 1737.

59 Elizabeth Harley, then unmarried, the daughter of Harley's
first wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Foley, of Whitley Court,
Worcestershire. She subsequently married the Marquis of Caermarthen,
afterwards Duke of Leeds.

60 Harcourt (see Letter 3, note 24).

61 William Stawel, the third baron, who succeeded to the title in 1692,
was half-brother to the second Baron Stawel. The brother here referred
to was Edward, who succeeded to the title as fourth baron in 1742.




LETTER 12.

1 Charles Finch, third Earl of Winchelsea, son of Lord Maidstone, and
grandson of Heneage, second Earl of Winchelsea. On his death in 1712
Swift spoke of him as "a worthy honest gentleman, and particular friend
of mine."

2 Vedeau was a shopkeeper, who abandoned his trade for the army
(Journal, March 28, April 4, 1711). Swift calls him "a lieutenant, who
is now broke, and upon half pay" (Journal, Nov. 18, 1712)

3 Sir Edmund Bacon, Bart. (died 1721), of Herringflat, Suffolk,
succeeded his father in the baronetcy in 1686.

4 The reverse at Brihuega.

5 See Letter 8, note 12.

6 John Barber, a printer, became Lord Mayor of London in 1732, and died
in 1741. Mrs. Manley was his mistress, and died at his printing office.
Swift speaks of Barber as his "very good and old friend."

7 Bernage was an officer serving under Colonel Fielding. In August 1710
a difficulty arose through Arbuthnot trying to get his brother George
made Captain over Bernage's head; but ultimately Arbuthnot waived the
business, because he would not wrong a friend of Swift's.
