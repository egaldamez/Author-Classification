death in 1729.

14 James, third Earl of Berkeley (1680-1736), whom Swift calls a "young
rake" (see Letter 16, note 15). The young Countess of Berkeley was
only sixteen on her marriage. In 1714 she was appointed a lady of the
bed-chamber to Caroline, Princess of Wales, and she died of smallpox
in 1717, aged twenty-two. The Earl was an Admiral, and saw much
service between 1701 and 1710; under George I. he was First Lord of the
Admiralty.

15 Edward Wettenhall was Bishop of Kilmore from 1699 to 1713.

16 In the Dedication to The Tale of a Tub Swift had addressed Somers in
very different terms: "There is no virtue, either in public or private
life, which some circumstances of your own have not often produced upon
the stage of the world."

17 Their lodgings, opposite to St. Mary's Church in Stafford Street,
Dublin.




LETTER 15.

1 The Stamp Act was not passed until June 1712: see the Journal for Aug.
7, 1712.

2 Both in St. James's Park. The Canal was formed by Charles II. from
several small ponds, and Rosamond's Pond was a sheet of water in the
south-west corner of the Park, "long consecrated," as Warburton said,
"to disastrous love and elegiac poetry." It is often mentioned as a
place of assignation in Restoration plays. Evelyn (Diary, Dec. 1, 1662)
describes the "scheets" used on the Canal.

3 Mrs. Beaumont.

4 The first direct mention of Hester Vanhomrigh. She is referred to
only in two other places in the Journal (Feb. 14, 1710-11, and Aug, 14,
1711).

where Stella now lodged.

words, and many others, he writes constantly ll for rr" (Deane Swift).

19 See Letter 4, note 19.

20 "Those letters which are in italics in the original are of a
monstrous size, which occasioned his calling himself a loggerhead"

7 Abigail Hill, afterwards Lady Masham, had been introduced into the
Queens service as bed-chamber woman by the Duchess of Marlborough. Her
High Church and Tory views recommended her to Queen Anne, and in 1707
she was privately married to Mr. Samuel Masham, a gentleman in the
service of Prince George (see Letter 14, note 6). The Duchess of
Marlborough discovered that Mrs. Masham's cousin, Harley, was using her
influence to further his own interests with the Queen; and in spite of
her violence the Duchess found herself gradually supplanted. From
1710 Mrs. Masham's only rival in the royal favour was the Duchess
of Somerset. Afterwards she quarrelled with Harley and joined the
Bolingbroke faction.

the living of Witney, Oxfordshire, which was worth 700 pounds a year.

12 Sir Jonathan Trelawney, one of the seven bishops committed to the
Tower in 1688, was translated to Winchester in 1707, when he appointed
Duke to be his chaplain.

18 Esther Johnson lodged opposite St. Mary's in Dublin.

19 This famous Tory club began with the meeting together of a few
extreme Tories at the Bell in Westminster. The password to the
Club--"October"--was one easy of remembrance to a country gentleman who
loved his ale.

20 "Duke" Disney, "not an old man, but an old rake," died in 1731. Gay
calls him "facetious Disney," and Swift says that all the members of the
Club "love him mightily." Lady M. W. Montagu speaks of his

     "Broad plump face, pert eyes, and ruddy skin,
      Which showed the stupid joke which lurked within."

Disney was a French Huguenot refugee, and his real name was Desaulnais.
He commanded an Irish regiment, and took part in General Hill's
expedition to Canada in 1711 (Kingsford's Canada, ii. 465). By his will
(Wentworth papers, 109) he "left nothing to his poor relations, but very
handsome to his bottle companions."

21 There were several Colonel Fieldings in the first half of the
eighteenth century, and it is not clear
