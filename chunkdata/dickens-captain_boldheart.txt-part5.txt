the hood of the machine, my boat shall intercept her
and prevent her return. Do you the rest."

"Mayor," returned Capt. Boldheart, "thou hast saved thy town."

The captain then signalled his boat to take him off, and steering her
himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathing-ground, and there to
rest upon their oars. All happened as had been arranged. His lovely
bride came forth, the Mayor glided in behind her, she became confused
and had floated out of her depth, when, with one skilful touch of the
rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat's crew, her adoring
Boldheart held her in his strong arms. There her shrieks of terror were
changed to cries of joy.

Before the Beauty could get under weigh, the hoisting of all the flags
in the town and harbour, and the ringing of all the bells, announced to
the brave Boldheart that he had nothing to fear. He therefore determined
to be married on the spot, and signalled for a clergyman and clerk, who
came off promptly in a sailing-boat named the Skylark. Another great
entertainment was then given on board the Beauty, in the midst of which
the Mayor was called out by a messenger. He returned with the news that
Government had sent down to know whether Captain Boldheart, in
acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a
Pirate, would consent to be made a Lieutenant-Colonel. For himself he
would have spurned the worthless boon, but his Bride wished it and he
consented.

Only one thing further happened before the good ship Family was
dismissed, with rich presents to all on board. It is painful to record
(but such is human nature in some cousins) that Captain Boldheart's
unmannerly cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a
rope's end "for cheekyness and making games," when Captain Boldheart's
lady begged for him and he was spared. The Beauty then refitted, and the
Captain and his Bride departed for the Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves
for evermore.
