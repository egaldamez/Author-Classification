illiam III., Macky had been given the direction of the
Ostend mail packets by Marlborough, to whom he communicated the news of

employment.

at the Court of Sweden in 1682, and had returned in 1708 with the double
reputation of being a thorough Churchman and a sound diplomatist. He was
soon made Dean of Windsor, and afterwards Bishop of Bristol. He was now
introduced to the Council Board, and it was made known to those in
the confidence of Ministers that he would be one of the English
plenipotentiaries at the coming Peace Congress. In 1713 Dr. Robinson was
made Bishop of London.

he had a bad reputation.
