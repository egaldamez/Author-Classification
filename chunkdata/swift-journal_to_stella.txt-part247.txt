arl Poulett (see Letter 20, note 7).

4 Francis Annesley, M.P. for Westbury. His colleague in the
representation of that borough was Henry Bertie (third son of James,
Earl of Abingdon), who married Earl Poulett's sister-in-law, Anthony
Henley's widow (see Letter 12, note 24).

5 "Has" (MS.).

6 A dozen words are erased. The reading is Forster's, and appears to be
correct.

7 The British Ambassadress's Speech to the French King. The printer was
sent to the pillory and fined.

8 The Examiner (vol. iii. No. 35) said that Swift--"a gentleman of the
first character for learning, good sense, wit, and more virtues than
even they can set off and illustrate"--was not the author of that
periodical. "Out of pure regard to justice, I strip myself of all the
honour that lucky untruth did this paper."

9 A purgative electuary.

10 Bargains.

11 Three or four words illegible. Forster reads, "Nite, nite, own MD."

12 Forster reads, "devil's brood "; probably the second word is "bawd:"
Cf. Letter 60, note 14 and Feb. 18, 1712-13.

13 Several "moving pictures," mostly brought from Germany, were on view
in London at about this time. See Tatler, No. 129, and Gay's Fables, No.

14 See Letter 6, note 45.

15 "Mr. Charles Grattan, afterwards master of a free school at
Enniskillen" (Scott).

16 So given in the MS. Forster suggests that it is a mistake for "wood."

17 See Letter 28, note 11.

18 It is probable that this is Pope's friend, William Cleland, who died
in 1741, aged sixty-seven. William Cleland served in Spain under Lord
Rivers, but was not a Colonel, though he seems to have been a
Major. Afterwards he was a Commissioner of Customs in Scotland and a
Commissioner of the Land Tax in England. Colonel Cleland cannot, as
Scott suggested (Swift's Works, iii. 142, xviii. 137-39, xix. 8), have
been the son of the Colonel William Cleland, Covenanter and poet, who
died in 1689, at the age of twenty-eight. William Cleland allowed his
name to be appended to a letter of Pope's prefixed to the Dunciad, and
Pope afterwards described him as "a person of universal learning, and an
enlarged conversation; no man had a warmer heart for his friends, or
a sincerer attachment to the constitution of his country." Swift,
referring to this letter, wrote to Pope, "Pray tell me whether your
Colonel (sic) Cleland be a tall Scots gentleman, walking perpetually in
the Mall, and fastening upon everybody he meets, as he has often done
upon me?" (Pope's Works, iv. 48, vii. 214).

19 Henry Grey, Lord Lucas (died 1741), who became twelfth Earl of Kent
in 1702, was made Duke of Kent in 1710. He held various offices under
George I. and George II.

20 Forster found, among the MSS. at Narford, the "lie" thus prepared for
All Fools' Day. Richard Noble, an attorney, ran away with a lady who
was the wife of John Sayer and daughter of Admiral Nevill; and he killed
Sayer on the discovery of the intrigue. The incident was made use of by
Hogarth in the fifth scene of "Marriage a la Mode."

25 Cibber says that he saw four acts of Cato in 1703; the fifth act,
according to Steele, was written in less than a week. The famous first
performance was on April 14, 1713.

26 The first number of the Guardian appeared on March 12, and the paper
was published daily until Oct. 1, 1713. Pope, Addison, and Berkeley were
among the contributors.

28 See Letter 39, note 16.

29 The first preached after the period of his suspension by the House
of Lords. It was delivered at St. Saviour's, Southwark, before his
installation at St. Andrew's, and was published with the title, "The
Christian's Triumph, or the Duty of praying for our Enemies".

31 Richard Gorges (died 1728) was eldest son and heir of Dr. Robert
Gorges, of Kilbrue, County Meath, by Jane, daughter of Sir Arthur
Loftus, and sister of Adam, Viscount Lisburne. He was appointed
Adjutant-General of the Forces in Ireland 1697, Colonel of a
new Regiment of Foot 1703, Major-General of the Forces 1707, and
Lieutenant-General 1710 (Dalton's Army Lists, iii. 75).

6 Francis Palmes, who was wounded at Blenheim, was made a
Lieutenant-General in 1709. In 1707 he was elected M.P. for West Loo;

1710 to Vienna.
